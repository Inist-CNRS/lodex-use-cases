	abstract = {Bibliometric methods or ‘‘analysis’’ are now ﬁrmly established as scientiﬁc specialties and are an integral part of research evaluation methodology especially within the scientiﬁc and applied ﬁelds. The methods are used increasingly when studying various aspects of science and also in the way institutions and universities are ranked worldwide. A sufﬁcient number of studies have been completed, and with the resulting literature, it is now possible to analyse the bibliometric method by using its own methodology. The bibliometric literature in this study, which was extracted from Web of Science, is divided into two parts using a method comparable to the method of Jonkers et al. (Characteristics of bibliometrics articles in library and information sciences (LIS) and other journals, pp. 449–551, 2012: The publications either lie within the Information and Library Science (ILS) category or within the non-ILS category which includes more applied, ‘‘subject’’ based studies. The impact in the different groupings is judged by means of citation analysis using normalized data and an almost linear increase can be observed from 1994 onwards in the non-ILS category. The implication for the dissemination and use of the bibliometric methods in the different contexts is discussed. A keyword analysis identiﬁes the most popular subjects covered by bibliometric analysis, and multidisciplinary articles are shown to have the highest impact. A noticeable shift is observed in those countries which contribute to the pool of bibliometric analysis, as well as a self-perpetuating effect in giving and taking references.},

	abstract = {While the breadth of applicative uses of data envelopment analysis (DEA) has increased over time, this non-parametric frontier methodology has proven effective for measuring how efficient decision-making units (DMUs) are. One of its uses is performance measurement in various organizations — from universities and banks to investment funds and entrepreneurial small and medium-sized enterprises. Following a search inquiry in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, we found no bibliometric analysis and keyword co-occurrence network visualization of just the use of DEA for performance management. With this study, we attempt to investigate the DEA literature for performance measurement and management, considering articles in scientific peer-reviewed journals, which are indexed in the Web of Science database. The analysis and visualization of the bibliometric data are based on 89 articles from the start of the century onward. We present the annual trends of published articles, journals, authors, and countries leading the scientific discussion and citation analysis. A detailed keyword visualization analysis was performed and is discussed in this article alongside the paths for future hotspots of the use of DEA for performance management. The findings have implications for both the academic community and practitioners, business leaders, managers, and policy-makers.},

In this paper, a bibliometric study was used like an assistance instrument for the strategic positioning of a scientific area. The aim of this bibliometric study was to help the work of an Advisory Scientific Committee by offering a global and "objective" view of the position and the evolution of the scientific activity of the Aix-Marseille area. The methodology employed was strongly inspired by strategic analysis methods carried out in companies. The implemented strategic analysis process involves the definition of strategic scientific units, the selection of competitors (a set of scientific areas), the choice of measuring criterion of the scientific activity, the evaluation of the dynamics over the years and the graphical representation of the scientific portfolio of the Aix-Marseille area. Such a strategic analysis process for analyzing a scientific portfolio allows positioning the strategic scientific fields of the Aix-Marseilles area in relation to the "competition" by taking into account the dynamic history of its activity.},

It connects this context with the contributions of evaluative bibliometrics, emphasising the transition towards a more integrative approach that advocates for a balance between quantitative and qualitative methods in research evaluation. Furthermore, it underscores how the Narrative Curriculum has emerged as one of the fundamental tools in new evaluation processes, as it allows for the description of the complexity and context of academic achieve­ ments. Narrative Bibliometrics is proposed, defined as the use of bibliometric indicators to generate stories that support the defence and exposition of a scientific curriculum and/or its individual contributions within the framework of a scientific evaluation process, which demands narratives. To introduce the reader, it presents, in a non-exhaustive manner, sources, indicators, and practical cases for effectively applying Narrative Bibliometrics in various scientific evaluation contexts. Hence, this document contributes to the responsible use of bibliometric indicators, serving as a tool for evaluators and researchers.},

Numerous scientometric studies have been carried out, but no study has attempted to investigate the overall research status of scientometrics. The objective of this study was to investigate the research status of scientometrics based on 16,225 publications archived in the Web of Science Core Collection between 1992 and 2020. The results show that there has been a marked increase in publications on scientometric studies over the past decades, with “Information Science Library Science” being the predominant discipline publishing scientometric studies, but scientometrics has been widely adopted in a variety of other disciplines (240 of 254 Web of Science categories). It was found that Web of Science, Vosviewer, and Scientometrics are the most utilized database, software, and journal for scientometric studies, respectively. The most productive author (Lutz Bornmann from the Max Planck Society, Germany), organization (University of Granada, Spain), and country (USA) are also identiﬁed. In addition, high-impact scientometric studies and the research landscape are analyzed through citation networks and the co-occurrence of keywords method.},

We identified the ten most frequently cited articles published in the top 15 highest impact factor primary care research journals. Article and journal metrics were extracted and summarized using descriptive statistics. We used Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) and log-log linear regression modelling to examine the relationship between citations and Altmetric score. 150 articles were included with a median of 36.5 (IQR 20-59; range 5-811) citations. We found a positive association between citations and Altmetric score (rs = 0.519; p {\textless} 0.001). A unit increase in log Altmetric score was associated with increased log citations [0.175 (95\% CI 0.091-0.259, p {\textless} 0.001)] in an adjusted linear regression model. The regression findings indicate that increasing Altmetric score by 10\% was associated with a 1.68\% increase in citation rate.

Firstly, this is the need for open access to scientometric data and improvement of their quality and comprehensiveness, including author data, affiliations, citations and meta information. The authors emphasize the necessity for large-scale introduction of technologies for identifying objects of science information (i. e. publications, researchers, organizations, projects, etc.), which would enable to decrease significantly the number of bibliographic mistakes. When projecting scientometric studies, the edge of objects and analysis instruments have to be defined by the goals rather than by bibliometric database limitations. Indexing of scientific publications is among the key instruments. Its advancement is determined by emerging and low-quality classifications of bibliometric databases, their differences, and changing science structure. Finally, the propriety of scientometric methods and results interpretation, in particular that of scientometric performance assessment, have to be controlled. Meeting these challenges will enable to provide efficient monitoring of scientific activity based on operative collection, processing and analysis of scientific information flows rather than on annual statistical surveys. This transfer would improve monitoring significantly and expand the spectrum of solutions; it would also enable to reveal system changes in research, to respond to disparities in development, and to make the solutions in science management more efficient.},

However, authors or funders often must pay the publishing costs, preventing authors who do not receive financial support from participating in OA publishing and gaining citation advantage for OA articles. OA may exacerbate existing inequalities in the publication system rather than overcome them. To investigate this, we studied 522,411 articles published by Springer Nature. Employing correlation and regression analyses, we describe the relationship between authors affiliated with countries from different income levels, their choice of publishing model, and the citation impact of their papers. A machine learning classification method helped us to explore the importance of different features in predicting the publishing model. The results show that authors eligible for article processing charge (APC) waivers publish more in gold OA journals than others. In contrast, authors eligible for an APC discount have the lowest ratio of OA publications, leading to the assumption that this discount insufficiently motivates authors to publish in gold OA journals. We found a strong correlation between the journal rank and the publishing model in gold OA journals, whereas the OA option is mostly avoided in hybrid journals. Also, results show that the countries' income level, seniority, and experience with OA publications are the most predictive factors for OA publishing in hybrid journals.},

This ranking formed the basis for the definition of the h-index. As an alternative methodology, the ranking of articles of a data set can be performed according to the distribution of the average citations of the articles. Applying this same principle to the h-index itself leads to an average h-index, the ha-index: the largest number of papers ha published by a researcher who has obtained at least ha citations per year on average. The new ha-index offers more consistency, increased selectivity, and fairer treatment of younger scholars compared to the classic h-index. With its normalized time aspect, the method leads to better acknowledgment of progress. The evolution of the h-indices over time shows how the ha-index reaches its full potential earlier and offers more stability over time. The average citation ha-index partly solves the problem of the temporality of the h-index. he ha-index can also be applied to academic journals. In particular, the application of the ha-index to journals leads to more stability as they reach their limit sooner. The ha-index offers a response to the inflation of h-index levels.},

An attempt is made to empirically validate the distinction between LIS context, L\&I services and information seeking as fragmented adhocracies and information retrieval and scientific communication (scientometrics) as technologically integrated bureaucracies.FindingsThe origin of fragmentation in LIS due the contributions of other disciplines can be traced in the 1960s and 1970s for solving the problems produced by the growth of scientific literature. Computer science and business established academic programs and started research relevant to LIS community focusing on information retrieval and bibliometrics. This has led to differing research interests between LIS and other disciplines concerning research topics and methods. LIS has been characterized as fragmented adhocracy as a whole, but we make a distinction between research topics LIS context, L\&I services and information seeking as fragmented adhocracies and information retrieval and scientific communication (scientometrics) as technologically integrated bureaucracies.Originality/valueThe paper provides an elaborated historical perspective on the fragmentation of LIS in the pressure of other disciplines. It also characterizes LIS as discipline in a fresh way by applying Whitley's (1984) theory.},

Specifically, it evaluates scientific production using production and citation indicators, and characterizes the main influencers on the recovered work through the analysis of co-citation between authors. For this, it searches for the term convergence culture in the Web of Science database and evaluates the production of articles over the years together with the citations received and reveals, through the analysis of co-citation between authors, the main influencers on the retrieved work. To analyze the co-citations, it uses the concept of diachronic recitations of authors per document to build the intellectual structure of the domain in question. As a result, it presents a low productivity of articles close to saturation, 34\% of the articles without citations received and with a clear deceleration of citations per article. It illustrates that the intellectual structure of the theme is composed of 46 authors most cited in the entire work, with emphasis on Henry Jenkins, Scolari, Williams, Bruns, Couldry, Deuze, Carpentier and Andrejevier. It concludes with low productivity on the subject and with strong influences from the pioneer Henry Jenkins, who is the most cited, recited and co-cited author among all cited authors.},

	abstract = {Objective: In the context of the development of information metric studies, this article proposes and applies a method for obtaining thematic indicators on descriptors representative of themes, subjects or keywords addressed in bibliographic records in the Information Science area. Method: A methodological research of applied nature was carried out, using technical procedures of automatic indexing and information metric studies. Initially, a corpus was delimited contemplating a set of bibliographic records referring to 60 articles of Brazilian journals. Later, the software Maui was applied as an automatic indexing system for categorizing the keywords of the bibliographic records into concepts of a specialty thesaurus, contemplating descriptors in the language of the metadata text. Next, the Iramuteq software was applied to generate the thematic indicators from the descriptors obtained by the automatic indexing. Finally, the proposed method was validated based on the analysis of the results obtained for the corpus. Result: The flowcharts for validation of automatic indexing and for validation of the information metric study are described, aiming to explain the processes of the proposed method as steps in processing the corpus. In addition, quality metrics for automatic indexing are presented, as well as statistical analyses of word frequency and co-occurrence, and term frequency, where the corpus' main thematic indicators are pointed out. Conclusions: We conclude that the thematic indicators obtained by applying the proposed method represent the main themes identified in the corpus, and that the method can be applied to obtain thematic indicators for other sets of bibliographic records.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the literature on the original disruption index (DI1) and its variants in scientometrics. The DI1 has received much media attention and prompted a public debate about science policy implications, since a study published in Nature found that papers in all disciplines and patents are becoming less disruptive over time. This review explains in the first part the DI1 and its variants in detail by examining their technical and theoretical properties. The remaining parts of the review are devoted to studies that examine the validity and the limitations of the indices. Particular focus is placed on (1) possible biases that affect disruption indices (2) the convergent and predictive validity of disruption scores, and (3) the comparative performance of the DI1 and its variants. The review shows that, while the literature on convergent validity is not entirely conclusive, it is clear that some modified index variants, in particular DI5, show higher degrees of convergent validity than DI1. The literature draws attention to the fact that (some) disruption indices suffer from inconsistency, time-sensitive biases, and several data-induced biases. The limitations of disruption indices are highlighted and best practice guidelines are provided. The review encourages users of the index to inform about the variety of DI1 variants and to apply the most appropriate variant. More research on the validity of disruption scores as well as a more precise understanding of disruption as a theoretical construct is needed before the indices can be used in the research evaluation practice.},

First, a systematic literature review of 47 publications authored and co-authored by Judit and devoted to this topic. Second, an interdisciplinarity analysis based on the cited references (publications cited by Judit) and citing documents (publications that cite Judit's work) through Scopus. The systematic literature review unravels an immense amount of search engines studied (43) and indicators measured (especially technical precision, overlap and fluctuation over time). In addition to this, an evolution over the years is detected from descriptive statistical studies towards empirical user studies, with a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. Otherwise, the interdisciplinary analysis evidences that a significant portion of Judit's oeuvre was intellectually founded on the computer sciences, achieving a significant, but not exclusively, impact on library and information sciences.},

Data mining is a crucial part of information retrieval; it is often termed as database knowledge discovery. It consists of techniques for examining massive data sets, to find hidden (but possibly important) information. Three interesting fields in data mining are affinity analysis, bibliomining, and technology mining. Affinity analysis provides data mining techniques to determine the similarity among objects; bibliomining is a combination of data mining, bibliometrics, and data warehousing; technology mining is a research topic that is an obstacle to many scientists in the fields of time association, enterprise association, and computer programming. We present a systematic review of the notable research articles in the fields of affinity analysis, bibliomining, and technology mining published between 2000 and December 2021. We provide a systematic analysis of the selected literature by specifying the major contributions, used data sets, performance evaluations, and limitations. Our findings demonstrate that affinity analysis interoperability extends well beyond market basket analysis. We also demonstrate that, in the age of big data, the personalized needs of users are the driving forces behind the evolution of the digital library from a resource-sharing service to a user-centered service.

Documents, drawn from the technological field of interest, are visualized as clusters on a two dimensional map, permitting exploration of the relationships among the documents and document clusters and also permitting derivation of summary data about each document cluster. Such information, when provided to subject matter experts performing a technology forecast, can yield insight into trends in the technological field of interest. This paper discusses the document visualization and analysis process: acquisition of documents, mapping documents, clustering, exploration of relationships, and generation of summary and trend information. Detailed discussion of DIVA exploration functions is presented and followed by an example of visualization and analysis of a set of documents about chemical sensors.

We found that the relative number of documents using one of the metrics-related terms is showing a more than exponential increase. This illustrates the increasing importance of metrics in the world of science. While most terms separately show a clear increase in use, web(o)metrics and perhaps, informetrics, seem to have reached their top. Bibliometrics and scientometrics are the most-used terms, with, nowadays, the term bibliometrics being used about five times more than the term scientometrics.

As compared to the MSDF methods in the sensor and other fields, and considering the features of scientometrics, in this paper an application model and procedure of MSDF in scientometrics are proposed. The model and procedure can be divided into three parts: data type integration, fusion of data relations, and ensemble clustering. Furthermore, the fusion of data relations can be divided into cross-integration of multi-mode data and matrix fusion of multi-relational data. To obtain a clearer and deeper analysis of the MSDF model, this paper further focuses on the application of MSDF in topic identification based on text analysis of scientific literatures. This paper also discusses the application of MSDF for the exploration of scientific literatures. Finally, the most suitable MSDF methods for different situations are discussed.},

This study systematically analyzes and compares the intellectual landscapes of the two domains between 2000 and 2014. The present study is based on bibliographic records retrieved from the Web of Science. Using a topic search and a citation expansion, we collected two sets of data in each domain. Then, we identified emerging trends and recent developments in information visualization and data visualization, captivated in intellectual landscapes, landmark articles, bursting keywords, and citation trends of the domains. We found out that both domains have computer engineering and applications as their shared grounds. Our study reveals that information visualization and data visualization have scrutinized algorithmic concepts underlying the domains in their early years. Successive literature citing the datasets focuses on applying information and data visualization techniques to biomedical research. Recent thematic trends in the fields reflect that they are also diverging from each other. In data visualization, emerging topics and new developments cover dimensionality reduction and applications of visual techniques to genomics. Information visualization research is scrutinizing cognitive and theoretical aspects. In conclusion, information visualization and data visualization have co-evolved. At the same time, both fields are distinctively developing with their own scientific interests.},

This temporal evaluation methodology bridges the gap between unstructured scientometrics networks and the evaluation process, making it a valuable tool for decision-making procedures. A case study is defined to demonstrate the potential to providevaluable insights into the dynamics and limitations of research groups, which ultimately reinforces the feasibility of the proposed approach when supporting decision making for funding agencies andresearch institutions.},

We obtained the following findings: The transfer of central research topics in the field of scientometrics is accelerating. There have been three milestones: the middle of the 1990s, 2005, and 2010. The number of central research topics has also changed from one between 1971 and 1993 to two after 1994 and three after 2008. At the same time, the geographical centres of scientometrics research showed a general shift from the US and Britain to Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, and China. At present, the countries that are centres of research include the Netherlands, US, Belgium, China, Spain, and Italy. There is a close positive correlation between the transfer of the central research topic and the transformation of the country to a centre of research. The countries acting as centres of research enjoy not only a high output of literature, but also a great academic influence. Both the theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.},

The results show that around 69\% of the publications in an average user library can be attributed to a single subject area. Then, we use co-readership patterns to map the field of educational technology. The resulting visualization prototype, based on the most read publications in this field on Mendeley, reveals 13 topic areas of educational technology research. The visualization is a recent representation of the field: 80\% of the publications included were published within ten years of data collection. The characteristics of the readers, however, introduce certain biases to the visualization. Knowledge domain visualizations based on readership statistics are therefore multifaceted and timely, but it is important that the characteristics of the underlying sample are made transparent.

The investigation revealed that around 30.34\% documents have open access. The major document type was articles (65.05\%), with journals (81.39\%) as major sources for document and English (92.70\%) as the dominant language for documents. The research also revealed that there has been a constant rise in the number of publications in the field since its inception and documents belong to different subject areas with social science leading the way. The major sources were Scientometrics (12.33\%) and Journal of Informetrics (3.18\%). Most productive authors were Mike Thelwall (41 documents), Lutz Bornmann (32 documents): most producing countries were USA (264 documents) United Kingdom (141 documents); and most producing organizations were University of Wolverhampton with 43 documents, Administrative Headquarters of the Max Planck Society with 32 documents. The visualization of author network revealed that collaborations between top authors are taking place but in a close knitted environment where one group of authors do not collaborate much with other group. The country collaboration network revealed that the top countries are extensively collaborating without any restrictions and developing countries like India, Pakistan are part of this collaboration network as well. The term map created out of the abstract and title information of research documents also revealed the trend of research in the altmetrics field.},

	abstract = {Historically, science of science (Sci2) studies have been performed by single investigators or small teams. As the size and complexity of data sets and analyses scales up, a "Big Science'' approach (Price, Little science, big science, 1963) is required that exploits the expertise and resources of interdisciplinary teams spanning academic, government, and industry boundaries. Big Sci2 studies utilize "big data'', i.e., large, complex, diverse, longitudinal, and/or distributed datasets that might be owned by different stake-holders. They apply a systems science approach to uncover hidden patterns, bursts of activity, correlations, and laws. They make available open data and open code in support of replication of results, iterative refinement of approaches and tools, and education. This paper introduces a database-tool infrastructure that was designed to support big Sci2 studies. The open access Scholarly Database (http://sdb.cns.iu.edu) provides easy access to 26 million paper, patent, grant, and clinical trial records. The open source Sci2 tool (http://sci2.cns.iu.edu) supports temporal, geospatial, topical, and network studies. The scalability of the infrastructure is examined. Results show that temporal analyses scale linearly with the number of records and file size, while the geospatial algorithm showed quadratic growth. The number of edges rather than nodes determined performance for network based algorithms.},

In this work, we propose the d-index, a novel measure that estimates the dependence degree between authors on their research environment along their entire scientific publication history. We also present a web application that implements these ideas and provides a number of visualization tools for analyzing and comparing scientific dependences among all the scientists in the DBLP bibliographic database.

We augment this dataset with semantic categories, obtained through automatic keyphrase extraction from papers' titles and abstracts, in order to provide the user with uniform keyphrases of the underlying data collection. We use the citations and references of papers to provide additional mechanisms for exploring relevant research by presenting aggregated reference and citation data not only for a single paper but also across topics, authors and journals, which is novel in our approach. We conduct a user study to evaluate our approach in which we asked 34 participants, from different academic backgrounds with varying degrees of research experience, to answer a variety of scientometric questions using our ConceptCloud browser.

We find that the distribution of figures and figure types in the literature has remained relatively constant over time, but can vary widely across field and topic. Remarkably, we find a significant correlation between scientific impact and the use of visual information, where higher impact papers tend to include more diagrams, and to a lesser extent more plots. To explore these results and other ways of extracting this visual information, we have built a visual browser to illustrate the concept and explore design alternatives for supporting viziometric analysis and organizing visual information.

These methods should not only be able to capture quantitative aspects of IDR but also to monitor evolutionary aspects and help answer the question of whether IDR stimulates collaboration and results in larger impact and visibility. Two specific indicators, variety and disparity, are developed, validated and applied to bibliometric data. They enable the visualization of the interdisciplinary nature of research activities at various levels of analysis (both institutional and individual). And, given the longitudinal character of bibliometric data and databases, both indicators allow for mapping time-dependent phenomena and evolutions.

	abstract = {Bibliometrics is used to apply statistical methods to books articles, and other publication. One research topic of bibliometrics is science mapping, which examines scientific objects to determine the cognitive structure, development, and acting persons. With CiteSpace and VOSviewer two of the most popular visualization tools are compared. The evaluation of the software solutions is carried out in two steps, the first step is a purely software technical evaluation based on the framework of Jadhav and Sonar (2011). In addition to functional similarities and differences between the tools, qualitative and technical aspects are examined. Both CiteSpace and VOSviewer, share a large number of bibliometric functionalities, which are each extended by additional functions. They use different algorithms for normalization, mapping and clustering. In the second part, on the basis of own case studies, in which selected bibliometric analyses (Co-Occurrence-, Co-Citation- and Co-Authorshipanalyses) are carried out, the workflow of solving a given task with these tools is analyzed and the results are evaluated. Both tools support the steps of a science mapping process, which consists of the phases of data retrieval, preprocessing, network extraction, normalization, mapping, analysis, visualization and interpretation. As a result, can be noted that visualizations created with VOSviewer have better clarity and user-friendliness. CiteSpace, on the other hand, offers advantages in the evaluative analysis of network visualizations, e.g. by enabling analysis of the cluster nodes using a Cluster Explorer. or paste your abstract here as prescribed by the journal's instructions for authors.

	abstract = {University rankings, despite facing criticism, continue to maintain their popularity. In the 2023 Scopus Ranking of Ukrainian Universities, certain institutions stood out due to their high h-index, despite modest publication and citation numbers. This phenomenon can be attributed to influential research topics or involvement in international collaborative research. However, these results may also be due to the authors' own efforts to increase the number of citations of their publications in order to improve their h-index. To investigate this, the publications from the top 30 universities in the ranking were analysed, revealing humpback rank-citation curves for two universities. These humpbacks indicate unusual trends in the citation data, especially considering the high percentage of self-citations and FWCI of analysed papers. While quantitative analysis has limitations, the combination of humped rank-citation curves, self-citations, FWCI, and previous research findings raises concerns about the possible causes of these anomalies in the citation data of the analysed universities. The method presented in this paper can aid ranking compilers and citation databases managers in identifying potential instances of citation data anomalies, emphasizing the importance of expert assessment for accurate conclusions.},

	abstract = {The package diverse provides an easy-to-use interface to calculate and visualize different aspects of diversity in complex systems. In recent years, an increasing number of research projects in social and interdisciplinary sciences, including fields like innovation studies, scientometrics, economics, and network science have emphasized the role of diversification and sophistication of socioeconomic systems. However, so far no dedicated package exists that covers the needs of these emerging fields and interdisciplinary teams. Most packages about diversity tend to be created according to the demands and terminology of particular areas of natural and biological sciences. The package diverse uses interdisciplinary concepts of diversity-like variety, disparity and balance-as well as ubiquity and revealed comparative advantages, that are relevant to many fields of science, but are in particular useful for interdisciplinary research on diversity in socioeconomic systems. The package diverse provides a toolkit for social scientists, interdisciplinary researcher, and beginners in ecology to (i) import data, (ii) calculate different data transformations and normalization like revealed comparative advantages, (iii) calculate different diversity measures, and (iv) connect diverse to other specialized R packages on similarity measures, data visualization techniques, and statistical significance tests. The comprehensiveness of the package, from matrix import and transformations options, over similarity and diversity measures, to data visualization methods, makes it a useful package to explore different dimensions of diversity in complex systems.},

The results of a questionnaire in which current practitioners rated bibliometric tasks as entry level, core or specialist are reported. Entry level competencies identified were explaining bibliometric concepts, doing basic calculations and some professional skills. Activities identified by participants as core are outlined. Reflecting on items that were considered in scope but specialist there was less stress on evaluating scholars, work at a strategic level, working with data outside proprietary bibliometric tools and consultancy-type services as opposed to training for disintermediated use. A competency model is presented as an appendix.},

Thirty library websites from the top 100 universities listed in the QS World University Rankings 2021 were selected for this study. The university library websites were examined and were visited many times for gathering data. The results obtained showed that DVS can be divided into five aspects: infor­ mation, services, training, tools and software, and information resources. Most libraries (93.3\%) offered data visualization tools and software such as Tableau, R, Excel, Gephi, and Plotly. Twenty-six libraries (86.67\%) provided information resources related to data visualization such as textbooks, data sources, external links to eresources, and blogs. Moreover, 80\% of the libraries offered DVS to the university community through their webpages. The findings of this study can help academic libraries improve DVS and draw the attention of libraries worldwide toward providing DVS in the future.},

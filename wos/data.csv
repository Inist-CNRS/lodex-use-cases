In birds, and particularly amphibians, these declines are a global phenomenon whose causes are often unclear. Among reptiles, snakes are top predators and therefore a decline in their numbers may have serious consequences for the functioning of many ecosystems. Our results show that, of 17 snake populations (eight species) from the UK, France, Italy, Nigeria and Australia, 11 have declined sharply over the same relatively short period of time with five remaining stable and one showing signs of a marginal increase. Although the causes of these declines are currently unknown, we suspect that they are multi-faceted (such as habitat quality deterioration, prey availability), and with a common cause, e.g. global climate change, at their root.";"snakes; sharp population declines; carrying capacity; global climate change";"AMPHIBIAN DECLINES; TRENDS; USA; CALIFORNIA";"Biology & Biochemistry; Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";"[Reading, C.

We discuss how processes governing methane wetland emissions, permafrost thawing, and destabilization of marine hydrates may affect the climate system. It is likely that methane wetland emissions will increase over the next century. Uncertainties arise from the temperature dependence of emissions and changes in the geographical distribution of wetland areas. Another major concern is the possible degradation or thaw of terrestrial permafrost due to climate change. The amount of carbon stored in permafrost, the rate at which it will thaw, and the ratio of methane to carbon dioxide emissions upon decomposition form the main uncertainties. Large amounts of methane are also stored in marine hydrates, and they could be responsible for large emissions in the future. The time scales for destabilization of marine hydrates are not well understood and are likely to be very long for hydrates found in deep sediments but much shorter for hydrates below shallow waters, such as in the Arctic Ocean. Uncertainties are dominated by the sizes and locations of the methane hydrate inventories, the time scales associated with heat penetration in the ocean and sediments, and the fate of methane released in the seawater. Overall, uncertainties are large, and it is difficult to be conclusive about the time scales and magnitudes of methane feedbacks, but significant increases in methane emissions are likely, and catastrophic emissions cannot be ruled out.

Temperature cooling shows direct positive association with the frequency of external aggression war to the Chinese dynasties mostly from the northern pastoral nomadic societies, and indirect positive association with the frequency of internal war within the Chinese dynasties through drought and locust plagues. The collapses of the agricultural dynasties of the Han, Tang, Song and Ming are more closely associated with low temperature.

Here, the authors suggest a set of measures to quantify the differences between CPs. A combination of clustering using Gaussian mixture models with a set of related difference measures allows for taking cluster size and shape information into account and thus provides more information than the Euclidean distances between cluster centroids. The characteristics of the various distance measures are illustrated with a simple simulated example. Subsequently, a five-component Gaussian mixture to define circulation patterns for the North Atlantic region from reanalysis data and GCM simulations is used. CPs are obtained independently for the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis and the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40), as well as for twentieth-century simulations from 14 GCMs of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) database. After discussing the difference of CPs based on spherical and nonspherical clusters for the reanalysis datasets, the authors give a detailed evaluation of the cluster configuration for two GCMs relative to NCEP-NCAR. Finally, as an illustration, the capability of reproducing the NCEP-NCAR probability density function (pdf) defining the Greenland anticyclone CP is evaluated for all 14 GCMs, considering that the size and shape of the underlying pdfs complement the commonly used Euclidean distance of CPs' mean values.";"";"WEATHER REGIMES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CLASSIFICATION SCHEME; SYNOPTIC CLIMATOLOGY; GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; ORGANIZING MAPS; VARIABILITY; REANALYSIS; GCM";"Geosciences";"Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Rust, Henning W.; Vrac, Mathieu] UVSQ, CEA, CNRS, LSCE IPSL, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Lengaigne, Matthieu; Sultan, Benjamin] Univ Paris 06, LOCEAN, Paris, France";"Rust, HW (reprint author), UVSQ, CEA, CNRS, LSCE IPSL, Bat 701, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.";"France";"France";"FRA";"12";"JOURNAL OF CLIMATE";"";"";"";"";"23";"24";"6573";"6589";"";"10.1175/2010JCLI3432.1";"0894-8755";"1520-0442";"";"0894-8755 eISSN: 1520-0442";"";"non";"0";"oui";"1";"Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire d'Océanographie et du Climat : Expérimentations et Approches Numériques (LOCEAN), UMR7159; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire d'Océanographie et du Climat : Expérimentations et Approches Numériques (LOCEAN), UMR7159; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"FR636; UMR7159; UMR8212";"FR636; UMR7159; UMR8212"

We tested whether and how species responses to climate change are related to the populations locations within the species thermal range. We compared the average 20 year growth rates of 62 terrestrial breeding birds in three European countries along the latitudinal gradient of the species ranges. After controlling for factors already reported to affect bird population trends (habitat specialization, migration distance and body mass), we found that populations breeding close to the species thermal maximum have lower growth rates than those in other parts of the thermal range, while those breeding close to the species thermal minimum have higher growth rates. These results were maintained even after having controlled for the effect of latitude per se. Therefore, the results cannot solely be explained by latitudinal clines linked to the geographical structure in local spring warming. Indeed, we found that populations are not just responding to changes in temperature at the hottest and coolest parts of the species range, but that they show a linear graded response across their European thermal range. We thus provide insights into how populations respond to climate changes. We suggest that projections of future species distributions, and also management options and conservation assessments, cannot be based on the assumption of a uniform response to climate change across a species range or at range edges only.";"biological traits; breeding bird monitoring; climate warming; climatic niche; population growth rate; thermal maximum";"EXTINCTION RISK; HABITAT MODELS; DISTRIBUTIONS; DEMOGRAPHY; IMPACTS; ECOLOGY; MONKEYFLOWERS; POLEWARDS; PHENOLOGY; MIGRATION";"Biology & Biochemistry; Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";"[Jiguet, Frederic] Ctr Rech Biol Populat Oiseaux, Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR MNHN CNRS UPMC 7204, F-75005 Paris, France; [Devictor, Vincent] Univ Montpellier 2, UMR CNRS UM2 5554, Inst Sci Evolut, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Ottvall, Richard; Lindstrom, Ake] Lund Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Van Turnhout, Chris] SOVON Dutch Ctr Field Ornithol, NL-6503 GA Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Van Turnhout, Chris] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Wetland & Water Res, Dept Anim Ecol, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Van Turnhout, Chris] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Wetland & Water Res, Dept Environm Sci, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Van der Jeugd, Henk] NIOO KNAW, Vogeltrekstn Dutch Ctr Avian Migrat & Demog, NL-6666 GA Heteren, Netherlands";"Jiguet, F (reprint author), Ctr Rech Biol Populat Oiseaux, Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR MNHN CNRS UPMC 7204, 55 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.";"France; Netherlands; Sweden";"France; Netherlands; Sweden";"FRA; NLD; SWE";"47";"PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES";"";"";"";"";"277";"1700";"3601";"3608";"";"10.1098/rspb.2010.0796";"0962-8452";"";"";"0962-8452";"";"oui";"1";"oui";"1";"Centre des Sciences de la Conservation (CESCO), UMR7204; Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier (ISEM), UMR5554";"Centre des Sciences de la Conservation (CESCO), UMR7204; Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier (ISEM), UMR5554";"UMR5554; UMR7204";"UMR5554; UMR7204"

These patterns of within-species niche variation raise the question of whether these differences should be considered when developing models for predicting the potential effects of climate change on species distributions. We address this question with two divergent datasets, one on sister species and subspecies from the European herpetofauna, the other on subspecies of breeding birds in North America. Atlas and observation data come from the Atlas of Amphibians and Reptiles in Europe and the North American Breeding Bird Survey, respectively. We develop boosted regression tree models of climate-distribution relationships and project the predicted geographic range of each taxon using interpolated weather station data and modeled climate for the year 2080. We find differences between models that distinguish the contributions of subtaxa and those that do not, in terms of prediction of both current and future distributions. In comparison to models that ignore sub-taxon structure, models that incorporate this structure generally predict larger areas of suitable conditions, consistently perform better, if only marginally, as measured by cross-validated AUC, and can reveal divergent potential effects of climate change on subtaxa. Differences in niche occupancy and predicted distribution appear between closely related taxa regardless of their phylogenetic distinctness. For these reasons, information on subtaxon membership and phylogeographic structure should be included in modeling exercises when available, in order to identify both the contribution of these units to the niche occupancy of species and the potentially distinct responses of subtaxa to climate change.";"";"SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA VARIATION; NORTHERN FLICKER; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; GENETIC-BASIS; FOX-SPARROW; BLUE TITS; DIFFERENTIATION; EVOLUTION; ACCURACY";"Environment/Ecology";"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";"[Pearman, Peter B.; Zimmermann, Niklaus E.] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Land Use Dynam Unit, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [D'Amen, Manuela] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Environm Biol, IT-00146 Rome, Italy; [Graham, Catherine H.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine, UMR CNRS 5553, FR-38041 Grenoble 9, France";"Pearman, PB (reprint author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Land Use Dynam Unit, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.";"France; Italy; Switzerland; United States";"France; Italy; Switzerland; United States";"CHE; FRA; ITA; USA";"43";"ECOGRAPHY";"";"";"";"";"33";"6";"990";"1003";"";"10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06443.x";"0906-7590";"1600-0587";"";"0906-7590 eISSN: 1600-0587";"";"oui";"1";"oui";"1";"Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553";"Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553";"UMR5553";"UMR5553"

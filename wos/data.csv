The XXL Survey IX. Optical overdensity and radio continuum analysis of a supercluster at z=0.43	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						catalogs; galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: groups: general; radio continuum: galaxies	EXTRAGALACTIC LEGACY SURVEY; TELESCOPE LENSING SURVEY; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; VLA-COSMOS SURVEY; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; SHAPLEY CONCENTRATION; IMAGING DATA; CLUSTER COMPLEX; STAR-FORMATION; WIDE FIELDS	We present observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 3 GHz (10 cm) toward a sub-field of the XXL-North 25 deg(2) field targeting the first supercluster discovered in the XXL Survey. The structure has been found at a spectroscopic redshift of 0.43 and extending over 0.degrees 35x0.degrees 1 on the sky. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we present the 3 GHz VLA radio continuum observations, the final radio mosaic and radio source catalogue, and, second, we perform a detailed analysis of the supercluster in the optical and radio regimes using photometric redshifts from the CFHTLS survey and our new VLA-XXL data. Our final 3 GHz radio mosaic has a resolution of 3 ''.2 x 1 ''.9, and encompasses an area of 41'x41' with rms noise level lower than similar to 20 mu Jy beam(-1). The noise in the central 15'x15' region is approximate to 11 mu Jy beam(-1). From the mosaic we extract a catalogue of 155 radio sources with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) >= 6, eight of which are large, multicomponent sources, and 123 (79%) of which can be associated with optical sources in the CFHTLS W1 catalogue. Applying Voronoi tessellation analysis (VTA) in the area around the X-ray identified supercluster using photometric redshifts from the CFHTLS survey we identify a total of seventeen overdensities at z(phot) = 0.35-0.50, 7 of which are associated with clusters detected in the XMM-Newton XXL data. We find a mean photometric redshift of 0.43 for our overdensities, consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts of the brightest cluster galaxies of seven X-ray detected clusters. The full VTA-identified structure extends over similar to 0.degrees 6x0.degrees 2on the sky, which corresponds to a physical size of similar to 12x4 Mpc(2) at z = 0.43. No large radio galaxies are present within the overdensities, and we associate eight (S/N > 7) radio sources with potential group/cluster member galaxies. The spatial distribution of the red and blue VTA-identified potential group member galaxies, selected by their observed g -r colours, suggests that the clusters are not virialised yet, but are dynamically young, as expected for hierarchical structure growth in a Lambda CDM universe. Further spectroscopic data are required to analyse the dynamical state of the groups.

THE COSMOS2015 CATALOG: EXPLORING THE 1 < z < 6 UNIVERSE WITH HALF A MILLION GALAXIES	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						catalogs; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: high-redshift; galaxies: photometry; methods: observational; techniques: photometric	STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; SIMILAR-TO 2; STELLAR MASS FUNCTION; WIDE-FIELD SURVEY; VLT DEEP SURVEY; SPECTRAL ENERGY-DISTRIBUTIONS; EVOLUTION SURVEY COSMOS; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; UV-SELECTED GALAXIES; NEAR-INFRARED SURVEY	We present the COSMOS2015(24) catalog, which contains precise photometric redshifts and stellar masses for more than half a million objects over the 2deg(2) COSMOS field. Including new YJHK(s) images from the UltraVISTA-DR2 survey, Y-band images from Subaru/Hyper-Suprime-Cam, and infrared data from the Spitzer Large Area Survey with the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Spitzer legacy program, this near-infrared-selected catalog is highly optimized for the study of galaxy evolution and environments in the early universe. To maximize catalog completeness for bluer objects and at higher redshifts, objects have been detected on a chi(2) sum of the YJHK(s) and z(++) images. The catalog contains similar to 6 x 10(5) objects in the 1.5 deg(2) UltraVISTA-DR2 region and similar to 1.5 x 10(5) objects are detected in the "ultra-deep stripes" (0.62 deg(2)) at K-s <= 24.7 (3 sigma, 3 '', AB magnitude). Through a comparison with the zCOSMOS-bright spectroscopic redshifts, we measure a photometric redshift precision of sigma(Delta z(1) (+ zs)) = 0.007 and a catastrophic failure fraction of eta = 0.5%. At 3 < z < 6, using the unique database of spectroscopic redshifts in COSMOS, we find sigma(Delta z(1) (+ zs)) = 0.021 and eta = 13.2%. The deepest regions reach a 90% completeness limit of 10(10)M(circle dot) to z = 4. Detailed comparisons of the color distributions, number counts, and clustering show excellent agreement with the literature in the same mass ranges. COSMOS2015 represents a unique, publicly available, valuable resource with which to investigate the evolution of galaxies within their environment back to the earliest stages of the history of the universe. The COSMOS2015 catalog is distributed via anonymous ftp and through the usual astronomical archive systems (CDS, ESO Phase 3, IRSA).	[Laigle, C.; McCracken, H.

We measure the angular correlation functions of these LBGs at z similar to 4, 5, 6, and 7 and fit these measurements using halo occupation distribution (HOD) models that provide an estimate of halo masses, M-h similar to (1-20) x 10(11) M-circle dot. Our M-h estimates agree with those obtained by previous clustering studies in a UV-magnitude versus M-h plane and allow us to calculate stellar-to-halo mass ratios (SHMRs) of LBGs. By comparison with the z similar to 0 SHMR, we identify evolution of the SHMR from z similar to 0 to z similar to 4 and from z similar to 4 to z similar to 7 at the > 98% confidence levels. The SHMR decreases by a factor of similar to 2 from z similar to 0 to 4 and increases by a factor of similar to 4 from z similar to 4 to 7 at the dark matter halo mass of M-h similar to 10(11) M circle dot. We compare our SHMRs with results of a hydrodynamic simulation and a semianalytic model and find that these theoretical studies do not predict the SHMR increase from z similar to 4 to 7. We obtain the baryon conversion efficiency (BCE) of LBGs at z similar to 4 and find that the BCE increases with increasing dark matter halo mass. Finally, we compare our clustering+HOD estimates with results from abundance matching techniques and conclude that the M-h estimates of the clustering+HOD analyses agree with those of the simple abundance matching within a factor of 3, and that the agreement improves when using more sophisticated abundance matching techniques that include subhalos, incompleteness, and/or evolution in the star formation and stellar mass functions.

The VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) Environmental effects shaping the galaxy stellar mass function	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: statistics; galaxies: interactions; large-scale structure of Universe	SIMILAR-TO 1; DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; VLT DEEP SURVEY; MORPHOLOGY-DENSITY RELATION; PROBE WMAP OBSERVATIONS; STAR-FORMATION HISTORIES; SMALL-MAGELLANIC-CLOUD; BROAD-BAND PHOTOMETRY; DARK-MATTER HALOES; LESS-THAN 1	We exploit the first public data release of VIPERS to investigate environmental effects in the evolution of galaxies between z similar to 0.5 and 0.9. The large number of spectroscopic redshifts (more than 50 000) over an area of about 10 deg(2) provides a galaxy sample with high statistical power. The accurate redshift measurements (sigma(z) = 0.00047(1+ z(spec))) allow us to robustly isolate galaxies living in the lowest and highest density environments (delta < 0.7 and delta > 4, respectively) as defined in terms of spatial 3D density contrast delta. We estimate the stellar mass function of galaxies residing in these two environments and constrain the high-mass end (M greater than or similar to 10(11) M-circle dot) with unprecedented precision. We find that the galaxy stellar mass function in the densest regions has a different shape than was measured at low densities, with an enhancement of massive galaxies and a hint of a flatter (less negative) slope at z < 0.8. We normalise each mass function to the comoving volume occupied by the corresponding environment and relate estimates from different redshift bins. We observe an evolution of the stellar mass function of VIPERS galaxies in high densities, while the low-density one is nearly constant. We compare these results to semi-analytical models and find consistent environmental signatures in the simulated stellar mass functions. We discuss how the halo mass function and fraction of central/satellite galaxies depend on the environments considered, making intrinsic and environmental properties of galaxies physically coupled, hence difficult to disentangle. The evolution of our low-density regions is described well by the formalism introduced by Peng et al. (2010, ApJ, 721, 193), and is consistent with the idea that galaxies become progressively passive because of internal physical processes. The same formalism could also describe the evolution of the mass function in the high density regions, but only if a significant contribution from dry mergers is considered.

A SEARCH FOR HYPERLUMINOUS X-RAY SOURCES IN THE XMM-NEWTON SOURCE CATALOG	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; black hole physics; catalogs; virtual observatory tools; X-rays: binaries	MASS BLACK-HOLE; ESO 243-49 HLX-1; SPECTRAL STATE TRANSITIONS; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; POINT-SOURCE CATALOG; HELLAS2XMM SURVEY; NUMBER COUNTS; GALAXIES; CHANDRA; SKY	We present a new method to identify luminous off-nuclear X-ray sources in the outskirts of galaxies from large public redshift surveys, distinguishing them from foreground and background interlopers. Using the 3XMM-DR5 catalog of X-ray sources and the SDSS DR12 spectroscopic sample of galaxies, with the help of this off-nuclear cross-matching technique, we selected 98 sources with inferred X-ray luminosities in the range 10(41) < L-X < 10(44) erg s(-1), compatible with hyperluminous X-ray objects (HLX). To validate the method, we verify that it allowed us to recover known HLX candidates such as ESO 243-49 HLX-1 and M82. X-1. From a statistical study, we conservatively estimate that up to 71 +/- 11 of these sources may be foreground- or background sources, statistically leaving at least 16 that are likely to be HLXs, thus providing support for the existence of the HLX population. We identify two good HLX candidates and using other publicly available data sets, in particular the VLA FIRST in radio, UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey in the near-infrared, GALEX in the ultraviolet and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Megacam archive in the optical, we present evidence that these objects are unlikely to be foreground or background X-ray objects of conventional types, e.g., active galactic nuclei, BL Lac objects, Galactic X-ray binaries, or nearby stars. However, additional dedicated X-ray and optical observations are needed to confirm their association with the assumed host galaxies and thus secure their HLX classification.	[Zolotukhin, I.; Webb, N.

A NEW CONSTRAINT ON THE PHYSICAL NATURE OF DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA SYSTEMS	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: high-redshift; intergalactic medium; quasars: absorption lines	HIGH-REDSHIFT GALAXIES; STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; BREAK GALAXIES; MORPHOLOGICAL SURVEY; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; ABSORBING GALAXIES; MASS DENSITY; Z-SIMILAR-TO-3; GAS; UV	The formation and evolution of galaxies require large reservoirs of cold, neutral gas. The damped Ly alpha systems (DLAs), seen in absorption toward distant quasars and gamma-ray bursts, are predicted to be the dominant reservoirs for this gas. Detailed properties of DLAs have been studied extensively for decades with great success. However, their size, fundamental in understanding their nature, has remained elusive, as quasar and gamma-rayburst sightlines only probe comparatively tiny areas of the foreground DLAs. Here, we introduce a new approach to measure the full extent of DLAs in the sightlines to extended background sources. We present the discovery of a high-column-density (log N(H I) = 21.1 +/- 0.4 cm(-2)) DLA at z similar to 2.4 covering 90%-100% of the luminous extent of a line-of-sight background galaxy. Estimates of the size of the background galaxy range from a minimum of a few kpc(2) to similar to 100 kpc(2) and demonstrate that high-column-density neutral gas can span continuous areas 10(8)-10(10) times larger than previously explored in quasar or gamma-ray-burst sightlines. The DLA presented here is the first from a sample of DLAs in our pilot survey that searches Lyman break and Lyman continuum galaxies at high redshift. The low luminosities, large sizes, and mass contents (greater than or similar to 10(6)-10(9) M-circle dot) implied by this DLA and the early data suggest that DLAs contain the necessary fuel for galaxies, with many systems consistent with relatively massive, low-luminosity primeval galaxies.

We selected a sample of 52 000 LOWZ and CMASS LRGs from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) SDSS-DR10 in the similar to 450 deg(2) that overlaps with imaging data from the second Red-sequence Cluster Survey (RCS2), grouped them into bins of absolute magnitude and redshift and measured their weak-lensing signals. The source redshift distribution has a median of 0.7, which allowed us to study the lensing signal as a function of lens redshift. We interpreted the lensing signal using a halo model, from which we obtained the halo masses as well as the normalisations of the mass-concentration relations. The concentration of haloes that host LRGs is consistent with dark-matter-only simulations once we allow for miscentering or satellites in the modelling. The slope of the luminosity-to-halo mass relation has a typical value of 1.4 and does not change with redshift, but we find evidence for a change in amplitude: the average halo mass of LOWZ galaxies increases by 25(-14)(+16)% between z = 0.36 and 0.22 to an average value of (6.43 +/- 0.52) x 10(13) h(70)(-1) M-circle dot. If we extend the redshift range using the CMASS galaxies and assume that they are the progenitors of the LOWZ sample, the average mass of LRGs increases by 80(-28)(+39)% between z = 0.6 and 0.2.

Measurements of cosmological parameters are affected as feedback alters the cosmic shear signal on angular scales smaller than a few arcminutes. Recent progress on the numerical modelling of baryon physics has shown that this effect could be so large that, rather than being a nuisance, the effect can be constrained with current weak lensing surveys, hence providing an alternative astrophysical insight on one of the most challenging questions of galaxy formation. In order to perform our analysis, we construct an analytic fitting formula that describes the effect of the baryons on the mass power spectrum. This fitting formula is based on three scenarios of the OverWhelmingly Large hydrodynamical simulations. It is specifically calibrated for z < 1.5, where it models the simulations to an accuracy that is better than 2 per cent for scales k < 10 h Mpc(-1) and better than 5 per cent for 10 < k < 100 h Mpc(-1). Equipped with this precise tool, this paper presents the first constraint on baryonic feedback models using gravitational lensing data, from the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). In this analysis, we show that the effect of neutrino mass on the mass power spectrum is degenerate with the baryonic feedback at small angular scales and cannot be ignored. Assuming a cosmology precision fixed by WMAP9, we find that a universe with massless neutrinos is rejected by the CFHTLenS lensing data with 85-98 per cent confidence, depending on the baryon feedback model. Some combinations of feedback and non-zero neutrino masses are also disfavoured by the data, although it is not yet possible to isolate a unique neutrino mass and feedback model. Our study shows that ongoing weak gravitational lensing surveys (KiDS, HSC and DES) will offer a unique opportunity to probe the physics of baryons at galactic scales, in addition to the expected constraints on the total neutrino mass.

Detected using the 3D-Matched-Filter (MF) cluster-finder of Milkeraitis et al., these cluster candidates span a wide range of masses, from the small group scale up to similar to 1015M(circle dot), and redshifts 0.2 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 0.9. The total significance of the stacked shear measurement amounts to 54 sigma. We compare cluster masses determined using weak lensing shear and magnification, finding the measurements in individual richness bins to yield 1 sigma compatibility, but with magnification estimates biased low. This first direct mass comparison yields important insights for improving the systematics handling of future lensing magnification work. In addition, we confirm analyses that suggest cluster miscentring has an important effect on the observed 3D-MF halo profiles, and we quantify this by fitting for projected cluster centroid offsets, which are typically similar to 0.4 arcmin. We bin the cluster candidates as a function of redshift, finding similar cluster masses and richness across the full range up to z similar to 0.9. We measure the 3D-MF mass-richness scaling relation M-200 = M-0(N-200/20)(beta). We find a normalization M-0 similar to (2.7(-0.4)(+0.5)) x 10(13)M(circle dot), and a logarithmic slope of beta similar to 1.4 +/- 0.1, both of which are in 1 sigma agreement with results from the magnification analysis. We find no evidence for a redshift dependence of the normalization. The CFHTLenS 3D-MF cluster catalogue is now available at cfhtlens. org.

The ATLAS(3D) project - XXIX. The new look of early-type galaxies and surrounding fields disclosed by extremely deep optical images	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques: photometric; galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD; galaxies: interactions; galaxies: photometry; galaxies: stellar content	DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; GENERATION VIRGO CLUSTER; FRANCE-HAWAII-TELESCOPE; H-I OBSERVATIONS; TO-LIGHT RATIO; ELLIPTIC GALAXIES; STELLAR POPULATIONS; DWARF GALAXIES; STAR-FORMATION; DISK GALAXIES	Galactic archaeology based on star counts is instrumental to reconstruct the past mass assembly of Local Group galaxies. The development of new observing techniques and data reduction, coupled with the use of sensitive large field of view cameras, now allows us to pursue this technique in more distant galaxies exploiting their diffuse low surface brightness (LSB) light. As part of the ATLAS(3D) project, we have obtained with the MegaCam camera at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope extremely deep, multiband images of nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs). We present here a catalogue of 92 galaxies from the ATLAS(3D) sample, which are located in low-to medium-density environments. The observing strategy and data reduction pipeline, which achieve a gain of several magnitudes in the limiting surface brightness with respect to classical imaging surveys, are presented. The size and depth of the survey are compared to other recent deep imaging projects. The paper highlights the capability of LSB-optimized surveys at detecting new prominent structures that change the apparent morphology of galaxies. The intrinsic limitations of deep imaging observations are also discussed, among those, the contamination of the stellar haloes of galaxies by extended ghost reflections, and the cirrus emission from Galactic dust. The detection and systematic census of fine structures that trace the present and past mass assembly of ETGs are one of the prime goals of the project. We provide specific examples of each type of observed structures - tidal tails, stellar streams and shells - and explain how they were identified and classified. We give an overview of the initial results. The detailed statistical analysis will be presented in future papers.

The survey consists of two fields centered approximately at (R.A., decl.) = (23(h), -55 degrees) and (5(h)30(m), -53 degrees) with imaging sufficient for the detection of L-star galaxies at redshift z <= 1. In this paper, we present our reduction of the survey data and describe a new technique for the separation of stars and galaxies. We search the calibrated source catalogs for galaxy clusters at z <= 0.75 by identifying spatial over-densities of red-sequence galaxies and report the coordinates, redshifts, and optical richnesses, lambda , for 764 galaxy clusters at z <= 0.75. This sample, >85% of which are new discoveries, has a median redshift of z = 0.52 and median richness lambda (0.4L L-star) = 16.4. Accompanying this paper we also release full survey data products including reduced images and calibrated source catalogs.

On the consistency of magnetic field measurements of Ap stars: lessons learned from the FORS1 archive	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						catalogs; stars: magnetic field; polarization; techniques: polarimetric	B-TYPE STARS; CHEMICALLY PECULIAR STARS; DA WHITE-DWARFS; STELLAR EVOLUTION; VLT; SPECTROPOLARIMETRY; DISCOVERY; DISTRIBUTIONS; TEMPERATURE; CALIBRATION	Context. The ESO archive of FORS1 spectropolarimetric observations may be used to create a homogeneous database of magnetic field measurements. However, no systematic comparison of FORS field measurements to those obtained with other instruments has been undertaken so far. Aims. We exploit the FORS archive of circular spectropolarimetric data to examine in a general way how reliable and accurate field detections obtained with FORS are. Methods. We examine the observations of Ap and Bp stars, on the grounds that almost all of the unambiguous detections of magnetic fields in the FORS1 archive are in these kinds of stars. We assess the overall quality of the FORS1 magnetic data by examining the consistency of field detections with what is known from previous measurements obtained with other instruments, and we look at patterns of internal consistency. Results. FORS1 magnetic measurements are fully consistent with those made with other instruments, and the internal consistency of the data is excellent. However, it is important to recognise that each choice of grism and wavelength window constitutes a distinct instrumental measuring system, and that simultaneous field measurements in different instrumental systems may produce field strength values that differ up to 20%, or more. Furthermore, we found that field measurements using hydrogen lines only yield results that meaningfully reflect the field strength as sampled specifically by lines of hydrogen for stars with effective temperatures above about 9000 K. Conclusions. In general the magnetic field measurements of Ap and Bp stars obtained with FORS1 are of excellent quality, accuracy and precision, and FORS1 provides an extremely useful example that offers valuable lessons for field measurements with other low-resolution Cassegrain spectropolarimeters.

The final PAndAS catalogue	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: haloes; galaxies: individual: M31; galaxies: star clusters: general	HORIZONTAL-BRANCH MORPHOLOGY; LOCAL GROUP GALAXIES; STAR-CLUSTERS; STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS; ACS PHOTOMETRY; YOUNG CLUSTERS; DWARF GALAXIES; GALACTIC HALO; MILKY-WAY; METALLICITY	We report the discovery of 59 globular clusters (GCs) and two candidate GCs in a search of the halo of M31, primarily via visual inspection of Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/MegaCam imagery from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS). The superior quality of these data also allows us to check the classification of remote objects in the Revised Bologna Catalogue (RBC), plus a subset of GC candidates drawn from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging. We identify three additional new GCs from the RBC, and confirm the GC nature of 11 SDSS objects (8 of which appear independently in our remote halo catalogue); the remaining 188 candidates across both lists are either foreground stars or background galaxies. Our new catalogue represents the first uniform census of GCs across the M31 halo - we find clusters to the limit of the PAndAS survey area at projected radii of up to R-proj similar to 150 kpc. Tests using artificial clusters reveal that detection incompleteness cuts in at luminosities below M-V = -6.0; our 50 per cent completeness limit is M-V a parts per thousand -4.1. We construct a uniform set of PAndAS photometric measurements for all known GCs outside R-proj = 25 kpc, and any new GCs within this radius. With these data, we update results from Huxor et al., investigating the luminosity function (LF), colours and effective radii of M31 GCs with a particular focus on the remote halo. We find that the GCLF is clearly bimodal in the outer halo (R-proj > 30 kpc), with the secondary peak at M-V similar to -5.5. We argue that the GCs in this peak have most likely been accreted along with their host dwarf galaxies. Notwithstanding, we also find, as in previous surveys, a substantial number of GCs with above-average luminosity in the outer M31 halo - a population with no clear counterpart in the Milky Way.

We confirm that JKCS 041 is a rich cluster and derive a redshift z = 1.80 via the spectroscopic identification of 19 member galaxies, of which 15 are quiescent. These are centered upon diffuse X-ray emission seen by the Chandra observatory. As JKCS 041 is the most distant known cluster with such a large, spectroscopically confirmed quiescent population, it provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of the environment on galaxy properties at early epochs. We construct high-quality composite spectra of the quiescent cluster members that reveal prominent Balmer and metallic absorption lines. Using these, we measure the mean stellar ages in two bins of stellar mass. The quiescent cluster members' ages agree remarkably closely with that inferred byWhitaker et al. for similarly selected samples in the field, supporting the idea that the cluster environment is more efficient at truncating star formation while not having a strong effect on the mean epoch of quenching. We find some evidence (90% confidence) for a lower fraction of disk-like quiescent systems in JKCS 041 compared to a sample of coeval field galaxies drawn from the CANDELS survey. Taking this into account, we do not detect a significant difference between the mass-radius relations of the quiescent JKCS 041 members and our z similar to 1.8 field sample. Finally, we demonstrate how differences in the morphological mixture of quenched systems can complicate measures of the environmental dependence of size growth.

By construction, the method is sensitive to configurations involving a massive foreground ETG and a faint, background, blue source. RingFinder detects the presence of blue residuals embedded in an otherwise smooth red light distribution by difference imaging in two bands. The method is automated for efficient application to current and future surveys, having originally been designed for the 150 deg(2) Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). We describe each of the steps of RingFinder. We then carry out extensive simulations to assess completeness and purity. For sources with magnification mu > 4, RingFinder reaches 42% (25%) completeness and 29% (86%) purity before (after) visual inspection. The completeness of RingFinder is substantially improved in the particular range of Einstein radii 0 ''.8 <= R-Ein <= 2.'' 0 and lensed images brighter than g = 22.5, where it can be as high as similar to 70%. RingFinder does not introduce any significant bias in the source or deflector population. We conclude by presenting the final catalog of RingFinder CFHTLS galaxy-scale strong lens candidates. Additional information obtained with Hubble Space Telescope and Keck adaptive optics high-resolution imaging, and with Keck and Very Large Telescope spectroscopy, is used to assess the validity of our classification and measure the redshift of the foreground and the background objects. From an initial sample of 640,000 ETGs, RingFinder returns 2500 candidates, which we further reduce by visual inspection to 330 candidates. We confirm 33 new gravitational lenses from the main sample of candidates, plus an additional 16 systems taken from earlier versions of RingFinder. First applications are presented in the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey galaxy-scale lens sample paper series.

Radio jets have long been argued to be an ideal mechanism that allows active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to interact with their host galaxies and affect star formation. We use a sample of radio sources in the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) field to study the nature of this putative link, by means of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We employ the excellent spectral coverage of the AKARI infrared space telescope and the rich ancillary data available in the NEP to build SEDs extending from UV to far-IR wavelengths. We find a significant AGN component in our sample of relatively faint radio sources (<mJy). A positive correlation is found between the luminosity of the AGN component and that of star formation in the host galaxy, independent of the radio luminosity. In contrast, for narrow redshift and AGN luminosity ranges, we find that increasing radio luminosity leads to a decrease in the specific star formation rate. The most radio-loud AGNs are found to lie on the main sequence of star formation for their respective redshifts. For the first time, we potentially see such a two-sided feedback process in the same sample. We discuss the possible suppression of star formation, but not total quenching, in systems with strong radio jets, that supports the maintenance nature of feedback from radio AGN jets.

Two spotted and magnetic early B-type stars in the young open cluster NGC 2264 discovered by MOST and ESPaDOnS	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars: fundamental parameters; stars: early-type; stars: individual: HD 47887; stars: individual: HD 47777; open clusters and associations: individual: NGC 2264; stars: magnetic field	LINE-DATA-BASE; ATMOSPHERIC NLTE-MODELS; UVBY-BETA PHOTOMETRY; MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS; MASSIVE STARS; ROTATIONAL VELOCITIES; EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE; BLUE STARS; SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS; ABUNDANCE ANALYSIS	Star clusters are known as superb tools for understanding stellar evolution. In a quest for understanding the physical origin of magnetism and chemical peculiarity in about 7% of the massive main-sequence stars, we analysed two of the ten brightest members of the similar to 10 Myr old Galactic open cluster NGC 2264, the early B-dwarfs HD47887 and HD47777. We find accurate rotation periods of 1.95 and 2.64 days, respectively, from MOST photometry. We obtained ESPaDOnS spectropolarimetric observations, through which we determined stellar parameters, detailed chemical surface abundances, projected rotational velocities, and the inclination angles of the rotation axis. Because we found only small (<5 km s(-1)) radial velocity variations, most likely caused by spots, we can rule out that HD47887 and HD47777 are close binaries. Finally, using the least-squares deconvolution technique, we found that both stars possess a large-scale magnetic field with an average longitudinal field strength of about 400 G. From a simultaneous fit of the stellar parameters we determine the evolutionary masses of HD47887 and HD47777 to be 9.4(-0.7)(+0.6) M-circle dot and 7.6(-0.5)(+0.5) M-circle dot. Interestingly, HD47777 shows a remarkable helium underabundance, typical of helium-weak chemically peculiar stars, while the abundances of HD47887 are normal, which might imply that diffusion is operating in the lower mass star but not in the slightly more massive one. Furthermore, we argue that the rather slow rotation, as well as the lack of nitrogen enrichment in both stars, can be consistent with both the fossil and the binary hypothesis for the origin of the magnetic field. However, the presence of two magnetic and apparently single stars near the top of the cluster mass-function may speak in favour of the latter.	[Fossati, L.; Castro, N.; Langer, N.; Schneider, F. R.

Using the mass map from the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey and a newly constructed tSZ map from Planck, we measure a nonzero correlation between the two maps out to one degree angular separation on the sky, with an overall significance of 6 sigma. The tSZ maps are formed in a manner that removes primary cosmic microwave background fluctuations and minimizes residual contamination by galactic and extragalactic dust emission, and by CO line emission. We perform numerous tests to show that our measurement is immune to these residual contaminants. The resulting correlation function is consistent with the existence of a warm baryonic gas tracing the large scale structure with a bias b(gas). Given the shape of the lensing kernel, our signal sensitivity peaks at a redshift z similar to 0.4, where half a degree separation on the sky corresponds to a physical scale of similar to 10 Mpc. The amplitude of the signal constrains the product (b(gas)/1)(T-e/0.1 keV)((n) over bar (e)/1 m(-3)) = 2.01 +/- 0.31 +/- 0.21, at redshift zero. Our study suggests that a substantial fraction of the "missing" baryons in the Universe may reside in a low-density warm plasma that traces dark matter.

THE EXTREMELY RED, YOUNG L DWARF PSO J318.5338-22.8603: A FREE-FLOATING PLANETARY-MASS ANALOG TO DIRECTLY IMAGED YOUNG GAS-GIANT PLANETS	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						brown dwarfs; parallaxes; planets and satellites: atmospheres; proper motions; solar neighborhood; surveys	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTRA; PROPER-MOTION SURVEY; HR 8799 PLANETS; FIELD L-DWARFS; BROWN DWARFS; T-DWARFS; ULTRACOOL DWARFS; MODEL ATMOSPHERES; MOVING GROUP; COOL NEIGHBORS	We have discovered using Pan-STARRS1 an extremely red late-L dwarf, which has (J - K)(MKO) = 2.78 and (J - K) (2MASS) = 2.84, making it the reddest known field dwarf and second only to 2MASS J1207-39b among substellar companions. Near-IR spectroscopy shows a spectral type of L7 +/- 1 and reveals a triangular H-band continuum and weak alkali (K I and Na I) lines, hallmarks of low surface gravity. Near-IR astrometry from the Hawaii Infrared Parallax Program gives a distance of 24.6 +/- 1.4 pc and indicates a much fainter J-band absolute magnitude than field L dwarfs. The position and kinematics of PSO J318.5-22 point to membership in the beta Pic moving group. Evolutionary models give a temperature of 1160(-40)(+30) K and a mass of 6.5(-1.0)(+1.3) M-Jup, making PSO J318.5-22 one of the lowest mass free-floating objects in the solar neighborhood. This object adds to the growing list of low-gravity field L dwarfs and is the first to be strongly deficient in methane relative to its estimated temperature. Comparing their spectra suggests that young L dwarfs with similar ages and temperatures can have different spectral signatures of youth. For the two objects with well constrained ages (PSO J318.5-22 and 2MASS J0355+11), we find their temperatures are approximate to 400 K cooler than field objects of similar spectral type but their luminosities are similar, i.e., these young L dwarfs are very red and unusually cool but not "underluminous." Altogether, PSO J318.5-22 is the first free-floating object with the colors, magnitudes, spectrum, luminosity, and mass that overlap the young dusty planets around HR 8799 and 2MASS J1207-39.

Strong variable linear polarization in the cool active star II Peg	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						polarization; stars: individual: II Peg; stars: individual: HR 1099; stars: individual: IM Peg; stars: individual: sigma Gem; stars: magnetic field	BINARY IM-PEGASI; STELLAR SURFACE-STRUCTURE; PROBE-B MISSION; AP-STARS; SIGMA-GEMINORUM; GUIDE STAR; LQ-HYDRAE; HR 1099; PARAMETERS; RECONSTRUCTION	Magnetic fields of cool active stars are currently studied polarimetrically using only circular polarization observations. Including linear polarization in the reconstruction of stellar magnetic fields allows more information about the magnetic field to be extracted and significantly improves the reliability of stellar magnetic field maps. The goal of this study is to initiate systematic observations of active stars in all four Stokes parameters and to identify cool stars for which linear polarization can be detected at a level sufficient for Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI). Four active RS CVn binaries, II Peg, HR 1099, IM Peg and sigma Gem, were observed with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope during a time period from 2012 February to 2013 January. The least-squares deconvolution procedure was applied to derive mean polarization profiles of all four Stokes parameters. Linear polarization was detected in all four stars in at least one observation. At the same time, II Peg showed an exceptionally strong and highly variable linear polarization signature throughout all observations. This establishes II Peg as the first promising target for ZDI in all four Stokes parameters and suggests the feasibility of such an analysis with existing equipment for at least a few of the most active cool stars.

BLUE STRAGGLERS IN THE LOWEST STELLAR DENSITY SYSTEMS	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						blue stragglers; galaxies: dwarf; galaxies: stellar content; Galaxy: halo; globular clusters: general; techniques: photometric	DWARF SPHEROIDAL GALAXY; MILKY-WAY SATELLITE; GALACTIC GLOBULAR-CLUSTERS; STAR-FORMATION HISTORY; CANES VENATICI-I; URSA-MAJOR II; VARIABLE-STARS; NGC 188; COMA BERENICES; MAIN-SEQUENCE	We present a homogeneous study of blue straggler stars across 10 outer halo globular clusters, 3 classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and 9 ultra-faint galaxies based on deep and wide-field photometric data taken with MegaCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We find blue straggler stars to be ubiquitous among these Milky Way satellites. Based on these data, we can test the importance of primordial binaries or multiple systems on blue straggler star formation in low-density environments. For the outer halo globular clusters, we find an anti-correlation between the specific frequency of blue stragglers and absolute magnitude, similar to that previously observed for inner halo clusters. When plotted against density and encounter rate, the frequency of blue stragglers is well fit by a single trend with a smooth transition between dwarf galaxies and globular clusters; this result points to a common origin for these satellites' blue stragglers. The fraction of blue stragglers stays constant and high in the low encounter rate regime spanned by our dwarf galaxies, and decreases with density and encounter rate in the range spanned by our globular clusters. We find that young stars can mimic blue stragglers in dwarf galaxies only if their ages are 2.5 +/- 0.5 Gyr and they represent similar to 1%-7% of the total number of stars, which we deem highly unlikely. These results point to mass-transfer or mergers of primordial binaries or multiple systems as the dominant blue straggler formation mechanism in low-density systems.

Classification and environmental properties of X-ray selected point-like sources in the XMM-LSS field	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						quasars: general; X-rays: general; galaxies: active; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; DUST-OBSCURED GALAXIES; SCALE STRUCTURE SURVEY; NEWTON-DEEP-FIELD; RADIO-LOUD AGN; REDSHIFT EVOLUTION; COSMOS FIELD; OPTICAL IDENTIFICATIONS; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; ANGULAR-CORRELATIONS	Context. The XMM-Large Scale Structure survey, covering an area of 11.1 sq. deg., contains more than 6000 X-ray point-like sources detected with the XMM-Newton to a flux of 3 x 10(-15) erg s(-1) cm(-2) in the [0.5-2] keV band. The vast majority of these sources have optical (CFHTLS), infrared (SWIRE IRAC and MIPS), near-infrared (UKIDSS), and/or ultraviolet (GALEX) counterparts. Aims. We wish to investigate the environmental properties of the different types of the XMM-LSS X-ray sources by defining their environment using the i'-band CFHTLS W1 catalog of optical galaxies to a magnitude limit of 23.5 mag. Methods. We have classified 4435 X-ray selected sources on the basis of their spectra, SEDs, and X-ray luminosity, and estimated their photometric redshifts, which have a 4-11 band photometry with an accuracy of sigma(Delta z/(1+zsp)) = 0.076 with 22.6% outliers for i' < 26 mag. We estimated the local overdensities of 777 X-ray sources that have spectro-z or photo-z calculated by using more than seven bands (accuracy of sigma(Delta z/(1+zsp)) = 0.061 with 13.8% outliers) within the volume-limited region defined by 0.1 <= z <= 0.85 and -23.5 < M-i' < -20. Results. Although X-ray sources may be found in variety of environments, a high fraction (greater than or similar to 55-60%), as verified by comparing with the random expectations, reside in overdense regions. The galaxy overdensities within which X-ray sources reside show a positive recent redshift evolution (at least for the range studied; z less than or similar to 0.85). We also find that X-ray selected galaxies, when compared to AGN, inhabit significantly higher galaxy overdensities, although their spatial extent appear to be smaller than that of AGN. Hard AGN (HR >= -0.2) are located in more overdense regions than soft AGN (HR < -0.2), which is clearly seen in both redshift ranges, although it appears to be stronger in the higher redshift range (0.55 < z < 0.85). Furthermore, the galaxy overdensities (with delta greater than or similar to 1.5) within which soft AGN are embedded appear to evolve more rapidly compared to the corresponding overdensities around hard AGN.

CFHTLenS spans 154 square degrees in five optical bands, with accurate shear and photometric redshifts for a galaxy sample with a median redshift of z(m) = 0.70. We estimate the 21 sets of cosmic shear correlation functions associated with six redshift bins, each spanning the angular range of 1.5 < theta < 35 arcmin. We combine this CFHTLenS data with auxiliary cosmological probes: the cosmic microwave background with data from WMAP7, baryon acoustic oscillations with data from Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and a prior on the Hubble constant from the Hubble Space Telescope distance ladder. This leads to constraints on the normalization of the matter power spectrum Sigma(8) = 0.799 +/- 0.015 and the matter density parameter (m) = 0.271 +/- 0.010 for a flat Lambda cold dark matter (Lambda CDM) cosmology. For a flat wCDM cosmology, we constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w = -1.02 +/- 0.09. We also provide constraints for curved Lambda CDM and wCDM cosmologies. We find the intrinsic alignment contamination to be galaxy-type dependent with a significant intrinsic alignment signal found for early-type galaxies, in contrast to the late-type galaxy sample for which the intrinsic alignment signal is found to be consistent with zero.

This data set is derived from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey Wide survey, and encompasses 154 deg(2) of high-quality shape data. Using the photometric redshifts, we divide the sample of lens galaxies with stellar masses in the range 10(9)-10(10.5) M-circle dot into those likely to lie in high-density environments (HDE) and those likely to lie in low-density environments (LDE). Through comparison with galaxy catalogues extracted from the Millennium Simulation, we show that the sample of HDE galaxies should primarily (similar to 61 per cent) consist of satellite galaxies in groups, while the sample of LDE galaxies should consist of mostly (similar to 87 per cent) non-satellite (field and central) galaxies. Comparing the lensing signals around samples of HDE and LDE galaxies matched in stellar mass, the lensing signal around HDE galaxies clearly shows a positive contribution from their host groups on their lensing signals at radii of similar to 500-1000 kpc, the typical separation between satellites and group centres. More importantly, the subhaloes of HDE galaxies are less massive than those around LDE galaxies by a factor of 0.65 +/- 0.12, significant at the 2.9s level. A natural explanation is that the haloes of satellite galaxies are stripped through tidal effects in the group environment. Our results are consistent with a typical tidal truncation radius of similar to 40 kpc.

This may allow us to constrain the understanding of the jet/wind launching mechanism, the location of the launching region, and the physical link with magnetospheric mass accretion. In 2010, observations were made at six different epochs to investigate how daily and monthly variability might affect such a study. We perform comparisons between the line profiles we observed and those in the literature over a period of decades and confirm the presence of time variability separate from the daily and monthly variability during our observations. This is so far consistent with the idea that these line profiles have a long-term variability (3-20 yr) related to episodic mass ejection suggested by the structures in the extended flow components. We also investigate the correlations between equivalent widths and between luminosities for different lines. We find that these correlations are consistent with the present paradigm of steady magnetospheric mass accretion and emission line regions that are close to the star.

Ice Hunters	2011 HM102: DISCOVERY OF A HIGH-INCLINATION L5 NEPTUNE TROJAN IN THE SEARCH FOR A POST-PLUTO NEW HORIZONS TARGET	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: general	KUIPER-BELT OBJECTS; POPULATIONS; COLORS; SYSTEM; PLANE	We present the discovery of a long-term stable L5 (trailing) Neptune Trojan in data acquired to search for candidate trans-Neptunian objects for the New Horizons spacecraft to fly by during an extended post-Pluto mission. This Neptune Trojan, 2011 HM102, has the highest inclination (29 degrees.4) of any known member of this population. It is intrinsically brighter than any single L5 Jupiter Trojan at H-V similar to 8.18. We have determined its gri colors (a first for any L5 Neptune Trojan), which we find to be similar to the moderately red colors of the L4 Neptune Trojans, suggesting similar surface properties for members of both Trojan clouds. We also present colors derived from archival data for two L4 Neptune Trojans (2006 RJ(103) and 2007 VL305), better refining the overall color distribution of the population. In this document we describe the discovery circumstances, our physical characterization of 2011 HM102, and this object's implications for the Neptune Trojan population overall. Finally, we discuss the prospects for detecting 2011 HM102 from the New Horizons spacecraft during its close approach in mid- to late-2013.

Distant galaxy clusters in a deep XMM-Newton field within the CFTHLS D4	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						cosmology: observations; dark matter; large-scale structure of Universe; X-rays: galaxies: clusters; surveys	COLOR-MAGNITUDE RELATION; STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; ESO IMAGING SURVEY; X-RAY; SURVEY I.; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; SERENDIPITOUS SURVEY; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; CATALOG; CFHTLS	Aims. The XMM-Newton distant cluster project (XDCP) aims at the identification of a well defined sample of X-ray selected clusters of galaxies at redshifts z >= 0.8. As part of this project, we analyse the deep XMM-Newton exposure covering one of the CFHTLS deep fields to quantify the cluster content. We validate the optical follow-up strategy as well as the X-ray selection function. Methods. We searched for extended X-ray sources in archival XMM-Newton EPIC observations. Multi-band optical imaging was performed to select high redshift cluster candidates among the extended X-ray sources. Here we present a catalogue of the extended sources in one the deepest similar to 250 ks XMM-Newton fields targetting LBQS 2212-1759 covering similar to 0.2 deg(2). The cluster identification is based on deep imaging with the ESO VLT and from the CFHT legacy survey, among others. The confirmation of cluster candidates is done by VLT/FORS2multi-object spectroscopy. Photometric redshifts from the CFHTLS D4 were utilised to confirm the effectiveness of the X-ray cluster selection method. The survey sensitivity was computed with extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. Results. At a flux limit of S0.5-2.0keV similar to 2.5 x 10(-15) erg s(-1) we achieve a completeness level higher than 50% in an area of similar to 0.13 deg(2). We detect six galaxy clusters above this limit with optical counterparts, of which 5 are new spectroscopic discoveries. Two newly discovered X-ray luminous galaxy clusters are at z >= 1.0, another two at z = 0.41, and one at z = 0.34. For the most distant X-ray selected cluster in this field at z = 1.45, we find additional (active) member galaxies from both X-ray and spectroscopic data. Additionally, we find evidence of large-scale structures at moderate redshifts of z = 0.41 and z = 0.34. Conclusions. The quest for distant clusters in archival XMM-Newton data has led to detection of six clusters in a single field, making XMM-Newton an outstanding tool for cluster surveys. Three of these clusters are at z >= 1, which emphasises the valuable contribution of small, yet deep surveys to cosmology. Beta models are appropriate descriptions of the cluster surface brightness when performing cluster detection simulations to compute the X-ray selection function. The constructed log N - log S tends to favour a scenario where no evolution in the cluster X-ray luminosity function (XLF) takes place.

MiMeS Collaboration	SEARCH FOR A MAGNETIC FIELD VIA CIRCULAR POLARIZATION IN THE WOLF-RAYET STAR EZ CMa	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						magnetic fields; polarization; stars: early-type; stars: Wolf-Rayet; techniques: polarimetric	DRIVEN STELLAR WINDS; COROTATING INTERACTION REGIONS; CANIS-MAJORIS; MASSIVE STARS; XMM-NEWTON; SPECTROPOLARIMETRIC OBSERVATIONS; IONIZATION STRATIFICATION; DYNAMICAL SIMULATIONS; SOBOLEV APPROXIMATION; ABSORPTION COMPONENTS	We report on the first deep, direct search for a magnetic field via the circular polarization of Zeeman splitting in a Wolf-Rayet (W-R) star. Using the highly efficient ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we observed at three different epochs one of the best W-R candidates in the sky expected to harbor a magnetic field, the bright, highly variable WN4 star EZ CMa = WR6 = HD 50896. We looked for the characteristic circular polarization (Stokes V) pattern in strong emission lines that would arise as a consequence of a global, rotating magnetic field with a split monopole configuration. We also obtained nearly simultaneous linear polarization spectra (Stokes Q and U), which are dominated by electron scattering, most likely from a flattened wind with large-scale corotating structures. As the star rotates with a period of 3.766 days, our view of the wind changes, which in turn affects the value of the linear polarization in lines versus continuum at the similar to 0.2% level. Depending on the epoch of observation, our Stokes V data were affected by significant crosstalk from Stokes Q and U to V. We removed this spurious signal from the circular polarization data and experimented with various levels of spectral binning to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of our data. In the end, no magnetic field is unambiguously detected in EZ CMa. Assuming that the star is intrinsically magnetic and harbors a split monopole configuration, we find an upper limit of B similar to 100 G for the intensity of its field in the line-forming regions of the stellar wind.

Discovery of a giant HI tail in the galaxy group HCG 44	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: groups: general; galaxies: groups: individual: HCG 44; galaxies: interactions; galaxies: ISM	HICKSON COMPACT-GROUPS; MORPHOLOGY-DENSITY RELATION; IA SUPERNOVAE; NEUTRAL HYDROGEN; VIRGO CLUSTER; LENTICULAR GALAXIES; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; ATLAS(3D) PROJECT; STAR-FORMATION; DARK GALAXIES	We report the discovery of a giant HI tail in the intragroup medium of HCG 44 as part of the ATLAS(3D) survey. The tail is similar to 300 kpc long in projection and contains similar to 5 x 10(8) M-circle dot of HI. We detect no diffuse stellar light at the location of the tail down to similar to 28.5 mag arcsec(-2) in g band. We speculate that the tail might have formed as gas was stripped from the outer regions of NGC 3187 (a member of HCG 44) by the group tidal field. In this case, a simple model indicates that about 1/3 of the galaxy's HI was stripped during a time interval of <1 Gyr. Alternatively, the tail may be the remnant of an interaction between HCG 44 and NGC 3162, a spiral galaxy now similar to 650 kpc away from the group. Regardless of the precise formation mechanism, the detected HI tail shows for the first time direct evidence of gas stripping in HCG 44. It also highlights that deep HI observations over a large field are needed to gather a complete census of this kind of events in the local Universe.

We identify a sample of 40 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) brighter than magnitude z' = 25.3 across an area of almost 4 deg(2). Sensitive spectroscopic observations of seven galaxies provide redshifts for four, of which only two have moderate to strong Ly alpha emission lines. All four have clear continuum breaks in their spectra. Approximately half of the LBGs are spatially resolved in 0.7 arcsec seeing images, indicating larger sizes than lower luminosity galaxies discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope, possibly due to ongoing mergers. The stacked optical and infrared photometry is consistent with a galaxy model with stellar mass similar to 10(10) M-circle dot. There is strong evidence for substantial dust reddening with a best-fit A(V) = 0.75 and A(V) > 0.48 at 2 sigma confidence, in contrast to the typical dust-free galaxies of lower luminosity at this epoch. The spatial extent and spectral energy distribution suggest that the most luminous z approximate to 6 galaxies are undergoing merger-induced starbursts. The luminosity function of z = 5.9 star-forming galaxies is derived. This agrees well with previous work and shows strong evidence for an exponential decline at the bright end, indicating that the feedback processes that govern the shape of the bright end are occurring effectively at this epoch.

To extend our knowledge on the mass function to the substellar regime, we have conducted a large observational survey of nearby young clusters (rho Oph, IC 348, Serpens, and lambda Ori). We adopted a twofold approach to this study, using both nearIR photometry to find all candidate substellar members and extensive spectroscopic follow-up to derive a spectroscopic IMF, and deep methane imaging to search for the lowest mass members. I will present the results of this longterm endeavor, where we have found no evidence for variations in the substellar mass function across different clusters, and have uncovered a handful of candidate young T dwarfs likely to represent the minimum mass for star formation.

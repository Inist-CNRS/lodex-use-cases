E.";REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS Volume: 48 Article Number: RG4005 Published: 2010;English;Review;We have reviewed the available scientific literature on how natural sources and the atmospheric fate of methane may be affected by future climate change. We discuss how processes governing methane wetland emissions, permafrost thawing, and destabilization of marine hydrates may affect the climate system. It is likely that methane wetland emissions will increase over the next century. Uncertainties arise from the temperature dependence of emissions and changes in the geographical distribution of wetland areas. Another major concern is the possible degradation or thaw of terrestrial permafrost due to climate change. The amount of carbon stored in permafrost, the rate at which it will thaw, and the ratio of methane to carbon dioxide emissions upon decomposition form the main uncertainties. Large amounts of methane are also stored in marine hydrates, and they could be responsible for large emissions in the future. The time scales for destabilization of marine hydrates are not well understood and are likely to be very long for hydrates found in deep sediments but much shorter for hydrates below shallow waters, such as in the Arctic Ocean. Uncertainties are dominated by the sizes and locations of the methane hydrate inventories, the time scales associated with heat penetration in the ocean and sediments, and the fate of methane released in the seawater. Overall, uncertainties are large, and it is difficult to be conclusive about the time scales and magnitudes of methane feedbacks, but significant increases in methane emissions are likely, and catastrophic emissions cannot be ruled out. We also identify gaps in our scientific knowledge and make recommendations for future research and development in the context of Earth system modeling.;;"GLOBAL CARBON-CYCLE; ICE-CORE RECORD; ORGANIC-COMPOUND EMISSIONS; ATMOSPHERIC CH4 GRADIENT; INTERANNUAL GROWTH-RATE; LAND-SURFACE SCHEME; PROCESS-BASED MODEL; SUB-ARCTIC YUKON; GAS-HYDRATE; NATURAL WETLANDS";Geosciences;Geochemistry & Geophysics;"[O'Connor, Fiona M.; Boucher, O.; Jones, C.

We tested whether and how species responses to climate change are related to the populations locations within the species thermal range. We compared the average 20 year growth rates of 62 terrestrial breeding birds in three European countries along the latitudinal gradient of the species ranges. After controlling for factors already reported to affect bird population trends (habitat specialization, migration distance and body mass), we found that populations breeding close to the species thermal maximum have lower growth rates than those in other parts of the thermal range, while those breeding close to the species thermal minimum have higher growth rates. These results were maintained even after having controlled for the effect of latitude per se. Therefore, the results cannot solely be explained by latitudinal clines linked to the geographical structure in local spring warming. Indeed, we found that populations are not just responding to changes in temperature at the hottest and coolest parts of the species range, but that they show a linear graded response across their European thermal range. We thus provide insights into how populations respond to climate changes. We suggest that projections of future species distributions, and also management options and conservation assessments, cannot be based on the assumption of a uniform response to climate change across a species range or at range edges only.;"biological traits; breeding bird monitoring; climate warming; climatic niche; population growth rate; thermal maximum";"EXTINCTION RISK; HABITAT MODELS; DISTRIBUTIONS; DEMOGRAPHY; IMPACTS; ECOLOGY; MONKEYFLOWERS; POLEWARDS; PHENOLOGY; MIGRATION";"Biology & Biochemistry; Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";"[Jiguet, Frederic] Ctr Rech Biol Populat Oiseaux, Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR MNHN CNRS UPMC 7204, F-75005 Paris, France; [Devictor, Vincent] Univ Montpellier 2, UMR CNRS UM2 5554, Inst Sci Evolut, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Ottvall, Richard; Lindstrom, Ake] Lund Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Van Turnhout, Chris] SOVON Dutch Ctr Field Ornithol, NL-6503 GA Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Van Turnhout, Chris] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Wetland & Water Res, Dept Anim Ecol, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Van Turnhout, Chris] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Wetland & Water Res, Dept Environm Sci, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Van der Jeugd, Henk] NIOO KNAW, Vogeltrekstn Dutch Ctr Avian Migrat & Demog, NL-6666 GA Heteren, Netherlands";Jiguet, F (reprint author), Ctr Rech Biol Populat Oiseaux, Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR MNHN CNRS UPMC 7204, 55 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.;"France; Netherlands; Sweden";"France; Netherlands; Sweden";"FRA; NLD; SWE";47;PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES;;;;;277;1700;3601;3608;;10.1098/rspb.2010.0796;0962-8452;;;0962-8452;;oui;1;2010;oui;1;2010;"Centre des Sciences de la Conservation (CESCO), UMR7204; Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier (ISEM), UMR5554";"Centre des Sciences de la Conservation (CESCO), UMR7204; Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier (ISEM), UMR5554";"UMR5554; UMR7204";"UMR5554; UMR7204";4 - Excellente

If it has been suggested that the poor quality of C-4 grasses contributed to large mammalian herbivores declines as C-4 grasslands spread from the late Miocene, these investigations of the past have not been matched by a similar attention focused on the future implications of C-4 to C-3 shifts. Here we discuss how these may affect grazing systems, also considering other aspects of C-3/C-4 differences (productivity, phenology) which might affect herbivore performance. Current knowledge suggests that important changes in herbivore performance could be observed, but is too fragmentary to allow general quantitative conclusions. We urge plant and herbivore ecologists to collectively address these limitations, as the future of grazing systems has important implications for biodiversity and human livelihoods.;;"ATMOSPHERIC CO2; ELEVATED CO2; SHORTGRASS STEPPE; MIOCENE EXPANSION; CLIMATE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; HYPOTHESIS; EVOLUTION; FUTURE";Environment/Ecology;Ecology;"[Chamaille-Jammes, Simon] CNRS, UMR 5175, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, FR-34293 Montpellier, France; [Bond, William J.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Bot, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa";Chamaille-Jammes, S (reprint author), CNRS, UMR 5175, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, 1919 Route Mende, FR-34293 Montpellier, France.;"France; South Africa";"France; South Africa";"FRA; ZAF";2;OIKOS;;;;;119;12;1857;1861;;10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.19070.x;0030-1299;;;0030-1299;;oui;1;2010;oui;1;2010;Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175;Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175;UMR5175;UMR5175;4 - Excellente

Sulphate was added to reactive aqueous solutions in the form of Na2SO4. Measured dissolution rates increase with increased sulphate concentration in acid conditions, but little effect was found in basic conditions. At pH 5, the presence of 0.01 mol/kg sulphate doubled the dissolution rate while 0.10 mol/kg of sulphate tripled the dissolution rate compared to that measured in sulphate-free solutions. This rate increase is found to be consistent with that calculated using an equation previously proposed by Gislason and Oelkers (2003), where the observed rate increase stems from the formation of aqueous Al-sulphate complexes. As the release of divalent cations is thought to be the rate limiting step for CO2 mineralization in basalt, adding aqueous sulphate to injected CO2 could accelerate carbonization processes in this rock during carbon sequestration efforts.

The GRACE mission has launched a new era in studying a series of geophysical problems ranging from deep Earth structure to tracking mass redistribution on and near the surface of the Earth. GRACE has greatly improved understanding of mass redistribution in various compartments of the climate system (atmosphere, oceans, terrestrial water, and cryosphere). In this review, we use examples to show how GRACE has fundamentally enriched a number of fields, including (but not limited to) the global water cycle and land hydrology, mass balance of polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers, ocean mass and global sea level change, and solid Earth geophysics.

To minimize scallop stress caused by excessive handling, in situ benthic chambers were used for the marking experiment, during an exposure time of 6 h. Once marked, scallops remained on site in a benthic cage and were collected 18, 26, and 41 days later. Apart from a few specimens affected by possible calcein toxicity effects, the detectable mark in all shells revealed a higher austral summer growth rate for A. colbecki compared to other Antarctic bivalves. Using calcein labeling, we identified a near 14-day periodicity in the striae formation associated with the fortnightly seawater level regime. Striae counting and increment width measurements showed an annual cycle, with no clear cessation of growth in juvenile specimens, allowing age determination. Because of the relatively high growth rate for a polar species and easily recognizable sclerochronological calendar in the shell striae formation, A colbecki is an appropriate species for high-resolution (infra-monthly) geochemical sampling. Comparison between LA-ICP-MS analyses (Li, B, Mg, Mn, Co, Sr, Ba, Pb) from one shell and hydrological parameters (sea level, temperature, salinity) measured in seawater suggests, however, that more work is needed to calibrate the trace element proxies. Nevertheless, the shell of the Antarctic scallop A colbecki has tremendous potential for recording environmental conditions from time periods covering months to a few years in polar waters, notably the ice melting date.

However, assessing the repercussions on apex marine predators remains a challenging issue, especially for pelagic species. In this study, we use Bayesian coalescent modelling of microsatellite variation to track the population demographic history of one of the smallest temperate cetaceans, the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in European waters. Combining genetic inferences with palaeo-oceanographic and historical records provides strong evidence that populations of harbour porpoises have responded markedly to the recent climate-driven reorganization in the eastern North Atlantic food web. This response includes the isolation of porpoises in Iberian waters from those further north only approximately 300 years ago with a predominant northward migration, contemporaneous with the warming trend underway since the 'Little Ice Age' period and with the ongoing retreat of cold-water fishes from the Bay of Biscay. The extinction or exodus of harbour porpoises from the Mediterranean Sea (leaving an isolated relict population in the Black Sea) has lacked a coherent explanation. The present results suggest that the fragmentation of harbour distribution range in the Mediterranean Sea was triggered during the warm 'Mid-Holocene Optimum' period (approx. 5000 years ago), by the end of the post-glacial nutrient-rich 'Sapropel' conditions that prevailed before that time.;"cetacean; climate change; habitat fragmentation; population genetics; coalescence";"PHOCOENA-PHOCOENA; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; TIME DEPENDENCY; NORTH-ATLANTIC; MUTATION-RATE; HUMAN-EVOLUTION; MARINE MAMMALS; LIFE-HISTORY; ANCIENT DNA; SEA";"Biology & Biochemistry; Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";"[Fontaine, Michael C.; Michaux, Johan R.; Baird, Stuart J.

Consequently, much research has focused on China's influence on climate change but somewhat less has been written about the impact of climate change on China. China experienced explosive economic growth in recent decades, but with only 7% of the world's arable land available to feed 22% of the world's population, China's economy may be vulnerable to climate change itself. We find, however, that notwithstanding the clear warming that has occurred in China in recent decades, current understanding does not allow a clear assessment of the impact of anthropogenic climate change on China's water resources and agriculture and therefore China's ability to feed its people. To reach a more definitive conclusion, future work must improve regional climate simulations-especially of precipitation-and develop a better understanding of the managed and unmanaged responses of crops to changes in climate, diseases, pests and atmospheric constituents.;;"YANGTZE-RIVER BASIN; LAST 50 YEARS; YELLOW-RIVER; CARBON-DIOXIDE; FUTURE CLIMATE; WINTER-WHEAT; ELEVATED CO2; TIBETAN PLATEAU; NORTHWEST CHINA; SPRING WHEAT";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Piao, Shilong; Shen, Zehao; Peng, Shushi; Zhou, Liping; Liu, Hongyan; Ma, Yuecun; Tan, Kun; Fang, Jingyun] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Coll Urban & Environm Sci,Dept Geog,Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong; Shen, Zehao; Peng, Shushi; Zhou, Liping; Liu, Hongyan; Ma, Yuecun; Tan, Kun; Fang, Jingyun] Peking Univ, Ctr Climate Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ciais, Philippe; Friedlingstein, Pierre] UMR CEA CNRS UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Huang, Yao; Yu, Yongqiang; Zhang, Tianyi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Atmospher Boundary Layer Phys & Atm, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Li, Junsheng] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Ding, Yihui] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Lab Climate Studies, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Friedlingstein, Pierre] Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, QUEST, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; [Liu, Chunzhen] China Water Informat Ctr, Hydrol Bur, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China";Piao, SL (reprint author), Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Coll Urban & Environm Sci,Dept Geog,Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;"France; People's Republic of China; United Kingdom";"France; People's Republic of China; United Kingdom";"CHN; FRA; GBR";360;NATURE;;;;;467;7311;43;51;;10.1038/nature09364;0028-0836;;;0028-0836;;oui;1;2010;oui;1;2010;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;UMR8212;UMR8212;5 - Exceptionelle

A better understanding of its past, current and predicted future environmental suitability will contribute to its conservation which is in jeopardy due to human activities, feral predators, disease and climate change. Here we use ecological niche modelling with all known occurrence data (N = 1708) and six determinant environmental variables to elucidate current, pre-human and future environmental suitability of this species. Comparison among independent runs, subfossil records and a clamping method allow validation of models. Many areas identified as currently suitable do not host any known populations. This apparent discrepancy could be explained by several non exclusive hypotheses: the areas have not been adequately surveyed and undiscovered populations still remain, the model is over simplistic; the species' sensitivity to fragmentation and small population size; biotic interactions; historical events. An additional outcome is that apparently suitable, but frog-less areas could be targeted for future translocations. Surprisingly, pre-human conditions do not differ markedly highlighting the possibility that the range of the species was broadly fragmented before human arrival. Nevertheless, some populations, particularly on the west of the North Island may have disappeared as a result of human mediated habitat modification. Future conditions are marked with higher temperatures, which are predicted to be favourable to the species. However, such virtual gain in suitable range will probably not benefit the species given the highly fragmented nature of existing habitat and the low dispersal ability of this species.

The spatial resolution ranges between 50 and 60 km over the whole country. Firstly, the link between local precipitation and weather regimes in the North Atlantic basin is investigated in terms of mean precipitation and the frequencies of occurrence for wet and intense precipitation days. Then a statistical downscaling approach that uses large-scale fields to construct local scenarios of future climate change is validated in the case of Moroccan winter precipitation. The outputs of experiments carried out from an ensemble of regional climate models are used to assess the uncertainties associated to future climate change. These dynamical downscaling outputs have been also used to test the robustness of the results related to the statistical downscaling technique. Our results concerning the future climate conditions over Morocco show not solely a decrease in mean precipitation but also a change in the precipitation distribution and in extreme events.

Gaining robust data sets on thermal regimes is critical to assess conditions to which species have adapted, detect extreme events and critically evaluate biological impacts. High resolution temperature (T) time series obtained during 1999-2006 from 5 to 40 m depth at four contrasted sites of the NWM were analyzed: Area Marina Protegida de les Illes Medes (NE Spain), Riou (Marseilles, France), Parc National de Port-Cros (France), and Reserve Naturelle de Scandola (Corsica, France). The seasonal pattern showed winter T around 11-13 degrees C, and summer T mainly around 22-24 degrees C near surface to 18-20 degrees C at depth. Stratification dynamics showed recurrent downwellings (>40 m) at Medes, frequent observation (1/3rd of the summer) of deep and cold upwelled waters at Riou, while Scandola exhibited stable summer stratification and highest suprathermoclinal T. Port-Cros showed an intermediate regime that oscillated between Riou and Scandola depending on the occurrence of northern winds. Data distribution study permitted to identify and to characterize 3 large scale positive anomalies concomitant with the mass mortality outbreaks of summers 1999,2003 and 2006. The analysis of biological surveys on gorgonian populations showed significant impacts during the 3 years with temperature anomalies. Besides the degree of impact showed inter-annual differences which could be related to different T conditions concomitant to mortality events, from slight increase in T extreme of only 1-2 degrees C over short duration, to lengthened more classical summer conditions. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that shallow NWM populations of long-lived benthic species are living near their upper thermal thresholds. Given actual trends and projections in NWM, the repetition of new MMEs in the next decades is extremely likely. In such context, the acquisition of dedicated high resolution T series proves to be crucial for increasing our detection, understanding and forecasting abilities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we use the best available global data sets on terrestrial biodiversity and carbon storage to map and investigate potential synergies between carbon and biodiversity-oriented conservation. A strong association (r(S) = 0.82) between carbon stocks and species richness suggests that such synergies would be high, but unevenly distributed. Many areas of high value for biodiversity could be protected by carbon-based conservation, while others could benefit from complementary funding arising from their carbon content. Some high-biodiversity regions, however, would not benefit from carbon-focused conservation, and could become under increased pressure if REDD is implemented. Our results suggest that additional gains for biodiversity conservation are possible, without compromising the effectiveness for climate change mitigation, if REDD takes biodiversity distribution into account.;"Biodiversity; climate change; deforestation; REDD; cobenefits; biological conservation; carbon stocks; UNFCCC; CBD; ecosystem services";"AMAZON RAIN-FOREST; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TROPICAL FORESTS; DIVERSITY; LAND; DEFORESTATION; EXTINCTIONS; EMISSIONS; STABILITY; THREAT";Environment/Ecology;Biodiversity Conservation;"[Strassburg, Bernardo B.

During glacial climate stages, for example, the world was much dustier, with dust fluxes two to five times greater than in interglacial stages. However, the influence of dust on climate remains a poorly quantified and actively changing element of the Earth's climate system. Dust can influence climate directly, by the scattering and absorption of solar and terrestrial radiation, and indirectly, by modifying cloud properties. Dust transported to the oceans can also affect climate via ocean fertilization in those regions of the world's oceans where macronutrients like nitrate are abundant but primary production and nitrogen fixation are limited by iron scarcity. Dust containing iron, as fine-grained iron oxides/oxyhydroxides and/or within clay minerals, and other essential micronutrients (e.g. silica) may modulate the uptake of carbon in marine ecosystems and, in turn, the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Here, in order to critically examine past fluxes and possible climate impacts of dust in general and iron-bearing dust in particular, we consider present-day sources and properties of dust, synthesise available records of dust deposition at the last glacial maximum (LGM); evaluate the evidence for changes in ocean palaeo-productivity associated with, and possibly caused by, changes in aeolian flux to the oceans at the LGM: and consider the radiative forcing effects of increased LGM dust loadings.

Different lines of evidence point to climate change, the arrival of humans, or a combination of these events as the trigger. Although many species went extinct, others, such as caribou and bison, survived to the present. The musk ox has an intermediate story: relatively abundant during the Pleistocene, it is now restricted to Greenland and the Arctic Archipelago. In this study, we use ancient DNA sequences, temporally unbiased summary statistics, and Bayesian analytical techniques to infer musk ox population dynamics throughout the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Our results reveal that musk ox genetic diversity was much higher during the Pleistocene than at present, and has undergone several expansions and contractions over the past 60,000 years. Northeast Siberia was of key importance, as it was the geographic origin of all samples studied and held a large diverse population until local extinction at approximate to 45,000 radiocarbon years before present ((14)C YBP). Subsequently, musk ox genetic diversity reincreased at ca. 30,000 (14)C YBP, recontracted at ca. 18,000 (14)C YBP, and finally recovered in the middle Holocene. The arrival of humans into relevant areas of the musk ox range did not affect their mitochondrial diversity, and both musk ox and humans expanded into Greenland concomitantly. Thus, their population dynamics are better explained by a nonanthropogenic cause (for example, environmental change), a hypothesis supported by historic observations on the sensitivity of the species to both climatic warming and fluctuations.;"climate change; human impact; quaternary; megafauna extinctions";"LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM; NORTHERN EURASIA; ICE-SHEET; WOOLLY MAMMOTHS; NEW-WORLD; GREENLAND; CLIMATE; EXTINCTIONS; INFERENCE; AMERICA";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Campos, Paula F.; Willerslev, Eske; Axelsson, Erik; Aaris-Sorensen, Kim; Gilbert, M.

We find that terrestrial water storage (TWS) from GRACE and precipitation display a common mode of variability at interannual time scale, with a minimum in late 2005, followed by a rise in 2006-2007. We argue that this event is due to forcing by the strong 2006 Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) on East African rainfall. We also show that GRACE TWS is linked to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation cycle. Combination of the altimetry-based lake water volume with TWS from GRACE over the lakes drainage basins allows estimating soil moisture and groundwater volume variations.

Nevertheless, the long-term environmental conditions prevailing prior to the main phase of marine extinction and carbonate production crisis remain poorly understood. Here we present a similar to 8 myr-long record of Early Pliensbachian-Middle Toarcian environmental changes from the Lusitanian Basin, Portugal, in order to address the long-term paleoclimatic evolution that ultimately led to carbonate production and biotic crises during the T-OAE. Paleotemperature estimates derived from the oxygen isotope compositions of well-reserved brachiopod shells from two different sections reveal a pronounced similar to 5 degrees C cooling in the Late Pliensbachian (margaritatus-spinatum ammonite Zones boundary). This cooling event is followed by a marked similar to 7-10 degrees C seawater warming in the Early Toarcian that, after a second cooling event in the mid-polymorphum Zone, culminates during the T-OAE. Calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)) contents, the amount of nannofossil calcite and the mean size of the major pelagic carbonate producer Schizosphaerella, all largely covary with paleotemperatures, indicating a coupling between climatic conditions and both pelagic and neritic CaCO(3) production. Furthermore, the cooling and warming episodes coincided with major marine regressions and transgressions, respectively, suggesting that the growth and decay of ice caps may have exerted a strong control on sea-level fluctuations throughout the studied time interval. This revised chronology of environmental changes shows important similarities with Neogene and Paleozoic episodes of deglacial black shale formation, and thus prompts the reevaluation of ice sheet dynamics as a possible agent of Mesozoic events of extinction and organic-rich sedimentation.

Both Pianka's overlap index, calculated per couple of successive samples, and cluster analysis, point to a number of significant turnover events highlighted by changes in the structure of floristic communities. The pre-warming flora, dominated by cosmopolitan species of the diatom genus Triceratium, is replaced during the warming interval by a new and more diverse assemblage, dominated by Paralia sulcata (an indicator of high productivity) and two endemic tropical species of the genus Hemiaulus. The critical warming interval is characterized by a steady increase in biogenic silica and a comparable increase in excess Ba, both reflecting an increase in productivity. In general, it appears that high productivity not only increased the flux of biogenic silica, but also sustained a higher diversity in the siliceous phytoplankton communities. The microflora preserved above the critical interval is once again of low diversity and dominated by various species of the diatom genus Hemiaulus. All assemblages in the studied material are characterized by the total absence of continental and benthic diatoms and the relative abundance of neritic forms, suggesting a transitional depositional environment between the neritic and the oceanic realms.

Populations of red gorgonian Paramuricea clavata in the NW Mediterranean Sea are threatened both by chronic and localized increases in mortality due to high diving activity and by widespread but episodic mass mortality events related to climatic anomalies. Using demographic data obtained from 3 populations (2 under contrasting levels of diving and one affected by a 1999 mass mortality event), we developed size-structured matrix models to forecast the long-term consequences of both disturbances and their combined effects. When we considered only the effects of diver damage, our results showed that population stability could be achieved with an increase in the annual survival of adult colonies of between 3 and 7%, demonstrating the need for diving reduction in the study locations, where there are estimated to be between 30000 and 70000 dives yr(-1). Modeling the effects of mass mortality events alone showed a low annual population growth rate (0.886) and near certain extinction risk over even short time scales. Considering these 2 types of impacts together, we found that the effects of mass mortality events aggravate the decline in gorgonian populations subjected to high diving impact, reaching the extinction threshold after 36 to 55 yr under the actual frequency of mass mortality events. Simulated reduction of diving effects dramatically increased the time to quasi-extinction for populations subjected to realistic frequencies of mass mortality events. Our simulations reveal the need of management actions to ensure the gorgonian viability in the face of climate change, and suggest that management of more controllable impacts, such as diving, can help buffer populations against the less controllable effects of climate change.;"Matrix models; Population viability analysis (PVA); Diving; Mass mortality events; Global warming; NW Mediterranean; Paramuricea clavata";"MASS MORTALITY EVENT; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; LIFE-HISTORY; EUNICELLA-SINGULARIS; MARINE INVERTEBRATE; LIGURIAN SEA; CORAL-REEFS; SUMMER 1999; RED-SEA; IMPACTS";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Plant & Animal Science";"Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography";"[Linares, Cristina] Univ Aix Marseille 2, CNRS, DIMAR, Ctr Oceanol Marseille,Stn Marine Endoume,UMR 6540, F-13007 Marseille, France; [Linares, Cristina] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Doak, Daniel F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA";Linares, C (reprint author), Univ Aix Marseille 2, CNRS, DIMAR, Ctr Oceanol Marseille,Stn Marine Endoume,UMR 6540, Rue Batteries Lions, F-13007 Marseille, France.;"France; Spain; United States";"France; Spain; United States";"ESP; FRA; USA";10;MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES;;;;;402;;59;68;;10.3354/meps08437;0171-8630;;;0171-8630;;oui;1;2010;oui;1;2010;Diversité, évolution et écologie fonctionnelle marine, UMR6540;Institut méditerranéen de biodiversité et d'écologie marine et continentale (IMBE), UMR7263;UMR6540;UMR7263;4 - Excellente

We report the results of a 3-yr common garden experiment designed to study the phenological response to artificial climate change, obtained through experimental warming and reduced precipitation, of several populations of three European oaks, two deciduous species (Quercus robur, Quercus pubescens) and one evergreen species (Quercus ilex), in a Mediterranean site. Experimental warming advanced the seedlings' vegetative phenology, causing a longer growing season and higher mortality. However, the rate of advancement of leaf unfolding date was decreased with increasing temperature. Conversely, soil water content did not affect the phenology of the seedlings or their survival.

High abundances of cold temperate dinocyst species (Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus, Spiniferites elongatus, Bitectatodinium tepikiense) and the polar planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (left coiling) reveal three major cooling events synchronous with North Atlantic Henrich events 1 and 2 (H1 and H2) and the European and North Atlantic Younger Dryas event.

Although positive correlations between the diversities of habitat and associated animals are often observed, the underlying mechanisms are only now starting to emerge, and none have been tested specifically in the marine environment. Scleractinian corals constitute the primary habitat-forming organisms on coral reefs and, as such, play an important role in structuring associated reef fish communities. Using the same field experimental design in two geographic localities differing in regional fish species composition, we tested the effects of coral species richness and composition on the diversity, abundance, and structure of the local fish community. Richness of coral species overall had a positive effect on fish species richness but had no effect on total fish abundance or evenness. At both localities, certain individual coral species supported similar levels of fish diversity and abundance as the high coral richness treatments, suggesting that particular coral species are disproportionately important in promoting high local fish diversity. Furthermore, in both localities, different microhabitats (coral species) supported very different fish communities, indicating that most reef fish species distinguish habitat at the level of coral species. Fish communities colonizing treatments of higher coral species richness represented a combination of those inhabiting the constituent coral species. These findings suggest that mechanisms underlying habitat-animal interaction in the terrestrial environment also apply to marine systems and highlight the importance of coral diversity to local fish diversity. The loss of particular key coral species is likely to have a disproportionate impact on the biodiversity of associated fish communities.;"biodiversity; climate change; coral reefs; diversity patterns; Great Barrier Reef; Australia; habitat-animal interactions; habitat loss; Kimbe Bay; northern Papua New Guinea; reef fish; resources; species richness";"PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CURRENT KNOWLEDGE; WOODY PLANT; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; SPECIALIZATION; ABUNDANCE; INSECTS; CLIMATE";Environment/Ecology;Ecology;"[Messmer, Vanessa; Jones, Geoffrey P.; Munday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Messmer, Vanessa; Jones, Geoffrey P.; Munday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Messmer, Vanessa] Univ Perpignan, CRIOBE, CNRS EPHE USR 23278, Moorea 98729, Fr Polynesia; [Holbrook, Sally J.; Schmitt, Russell J.; Brooks, Andrew J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Holbrook, Sally J.; Schmitt, Russell J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA";Messmer, V (reprint author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;"Australia; France; French Polynesia; United States";"Australia; France; United States";"AUS; FRA; USA";28;ECOLOGY;;;;;92;12;2285;2298;;;0012-9658;;;0012-9658;;oui;1;2011;oui;1;2011;Centre de recherche insulaire et observatoire de l'environnement (CRIOBE), USR3278;Centre de recherche insulaire et observatoire de l'environnement (CRIOBE), USR3278;USR3278;USR3278;4 - Excellente

Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere warm the mid-latitudes more than the tropics, in part owing to a reduced snow-albedo feedback as snow cover decreases(2). Higher concentration of carbon dioxide also increases precipitation in many regions(1), as a result of an intensification of the hydrological cycle(2). The biophysical effects of LULCC since pre-industrial times have probably cooled temperate and boreal regions and warmed some tropical regions(3). Here we use a climate model to show that how snow and rainfall change under increased greenhouse gases dominates how LULCC affects regional temperature. Increased greenhouse-gas-driven changes in snow and rainfall affect the snow-albedo feedback and the supply of water, which in turn limits evaporation. These changes largely control the net impact of LULCC on regional climate. Our results show that capturing whether future biophysical changes due to LULCC warm or cool a specific region therefore requires an accurate simulation of changes in snow cover and rainfall geographically coincident with regions of LULCC. This is a challenge to current climate models, but also provides potential for further improving detection and attribution methods.;;"TROPICAL DEFORESTATION; MODELS";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Pitman, A.

We reported on the response of both haploid and diploid life stages of these three species. Growth rate, cell size, particulate inorganic carbon (PIC), and particulate organic carbon (POC) of both life stages were measured at two different pCO(2) (400 and 760 parts per million [ppm]), and their organic and inorganic carbon production were calculated. The two life stages within the same species generally exhibited a similar response to elevated pCO(2), the response of the haploid stage being often more pronounced than that of the diploid stage. The growth rate was consistently higher at elevated pCO(2), but the response of other processes varied among species. Calcification rate of C. leptoporus and of S. pulchra did not change at elevated pCO(2), whereas it increased in E. huxleyi. POC production and cell size of both life stages of S. pulchra and of the haploid stage of E. huxleyi markedly decreased at elevated pCO(2). It remained unaltered in the diploid stage of E. huxleyi and C. leptoporus and increased in the haploid stage of the latter. The PIC:POC ratio increased in E. huxleyi and was constant in C. leptoporus and S. pulchra. Elevated pCO(2) has a significant effect on these three coccolithophore species, the haploid stage being more sensitive.

While these parameters have been used in numerical simulations to model the occurrences of some types of dunes, they cannot alone explain the great diversity in form and size seen on Earth and on other solar system bodies. Here we present results from our studies of dune formation in the Badain Jaran Desert in western China, where Earth's tallest dunes occur. We measured the variability of the dune morphology in this desert on the basis of LANDSAT ETM+ data, and we detected the bedrock landforms beneath the aeolian sands by applying gravity methods. Wind records from stations at the periphery of the desert and SRTM topographical data were examined also to augment the interpretation. Our studies demonstrate that in addition to average wind parameters, dune height is highly sensitive to local geology, subsurface characteristics, and topography, and interactions between changing climate conditions and aeolian and fluvial processes. These additional factors need to be considered in the interpretation and simulation of dunes on Earth. We anticipate that analysis of anomalous dune heights like those seen in the Badain Jaran may also provide critical information on subsurface characteristics and environmental conditions on Earth and on other planetary bodies.

A stratified resampling approach was used to investigate the potential impact of changing levels of atmospheric nitrogen deposition and climate change on species composition of nutrient-poor acid grasslands within the French Atlantic Domain (FAD). The study was based on a comparison, over a period of 25 years, of 162 past and present vegetation records assigned to the species-rich Nardus grasslands and distributed in regional community types (CTs). Similarly, the characterization of N deposition and climate was stratified according to (i) past (1980-1990) and present (1995-2005) periods, and (ii) FAD and CT scales. Despite the relatively short time span between sampling periods, significant N deposition and climate changes were detected as well as vegetation changes. Correspondence analysis showed that the relative importance of N deposition and climate in explaining vegetation changes depended on the spatial scale of investigation (FAD vs. local CTs) and the CT. At the FAD scale, the increase of annual mean temperature and decrease of water availability were clearly related to the changes in floristic composition. At the local scale, the most stable CT experienced no significant climate change and a stable load of N deposition, whereas the CTs characterized by the largest floristic changes were associated with dramatic climate changes and moderate loads in both oxidized and reduced N deposition. Despite the narrow gradient of deposition investigated, N deposition was related to significant grassland community changes, depending on the region, i. e. climate context, and on whether N deposition was in the oxidized or reduced form. Our results suggest that N deposition drives grassland composition at the local scale, in interaction with climate, whereas climate changes remain the predominant driver at the FAD scale.;"climate change; French Atlantic Domain; oxidized and reduced nitrogen deposition; resampling; species composition; species-rich Nardus grasslands";"SPECIES RICHNESS; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; FROST HARDINESS; DIVERSITY; EUROPE; SOIL; BIODIVERSITY; HEATHLAND; TRENDS; CYCLE";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Gaudnik, Cassandre; Corcket, Emmanuel; Alard, Didier] Univ Bordeaux, BIOGECO UMR1202, F-33405 Talence, France; [Gaudnik, Cassandre; Corcket, Emmanuel; Alard, Didier] INRA, BIOGECO UMR1202, F-33400 Talence, France; [Clement, Bernard] Univ Rennes 1, ECOBIO, CNRS, UMR 6553, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Delmas, Chloe E.

It is therefore essential to estimate the snowmelt runoff from these catchments (with no or scarce precipitation records) for water resources management. The snowmelt runoff model (SRM) integrated with MODIS remote-sensing snow cover products was selected to simulate the daily discharges and to study the climate change impact on these discharges in the Hunza River basin (the snow- and glacier-fed sub-catchment of the Indus River). The results obtained suggest that the SRM can be used efficiently in the snow- and glacier-fed sub-catchments of the Upper Indus River Basin (UIB). The application of the SRM under future climate (mean temperature, precipitation and snow cover) change scenarios indicates a doubling of summer runoff until the middle of this century. This analysis suggests that new reservoirs will be necessary for summer flow storage to meet with the needs of irrigation supply, increasing power generation demand, flood control and water supply.

Here, we develop a conceptual model that incorporates the main heat-exchange processes in a rock cleft. Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations based on the model indicate that latent heat release due to initial ice aggradation can rapidly warm cold bedrock and precondition it for later thermal erosion of cleft ice by advected sensible heat. The timing and duration of water percolation both affect the ice-level change if initial aggradation and subsequent erosion are of the same order of magnitude. The surplus advected heat is absorbed by cleft ice loss and runoff from the cleft so that this energy is not directly detectable in ground temperature records. Our findings suggest that thawing-related rockfall is possible even in cold permafrost if meltwater production and flow characteristics change significantly. Advective warming could rapidly affect failure planes beneath large rock masses and failure events could therefore differ greatly from common magnitude reaction-time relations.

Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the dramatic decline of this colony, including changes in sea ice conditions, predation, flipper banding and human disturbance. Here, we report and analyse updated long-term trends in numbers of breeding pairs made at two colonies (Pointe Geologie and Haswell Island) where counts are comparable. Similar changes were observed for both colonies and paralleled changes in sea ice extent. At Pointe Geologie and Haswell Island, populations declined similarly and later growth rates were also similar since the early 1990s for Haswell and early 1980s for Pointe Geologie.

Here, we used eddy covariance measurements of NEE from 20 FLUXNET sites (203 site-years of data) in mid-and high-latitude forests to investigate the temperature response of NEE. Years were divided into two half thermal years (increasing temperature in spring and decreasing temperature in autumn) using the maximum daily mean temperature. We observed a parabolic-like pattern of NEE in response to temperature change in both the spring and autumn half thermal years. However, at similar temperatures, NEE was considerably depressed during the decreasing temperature season as compared with the increasing temperature season, inducing a counter-clockwise hysteresis pattern in the NEE-temperature relation at most sites. The magnitude of this hysteresis was attributable mostly (68%) to gross primary production (GPP) differences but little (8%) to ecosystem respiration (ER) differences between the two half thermal years. The main environmental factors contributing to the hysteresis responses of NEE and GPP were daily accumulated radiation. Soil water content (SWC) also contributed to the hysteresis response of GPP but only at some sites. Shorter day length, lower light intensity, lower SWC and reduced photosynthetic capacity may all have contributed to the depressed GPP and net carbon uptake during the decreasing temperature seasons. The resultant hysteresis loop is an important indicator of the existence of limiting factors. As such, the role of radiation, LAI and SWC should be considered when modeling the dynamics of carbon cycling in response to temperature change.;"carbon cycle; climate change; day length; ecosystem respiration; gross ecosystem productivity; leaf area index; seasonal variation; temperature sensitivity";"CARBON-DIOXIDE EXCHANGE; SCOTS PINE FOREST; SUB-ALPINE FOREST; SOIL RESPIRATION; DECIDUOUS FOREST; SOLAR-RADIATION; BOREAL FOREST; CO2 EXCHANGE; BEECH FOREST; SOUTHERN FINLAND";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Niu, Shuli; Luo, Yiqi; Fei, Shenfeng] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Niu, Shuli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Montagnani, Leonardo] Prov Autonoma Bolzano, Serv Forestali, Agenzia Ambiente, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Montagnani, Leonardo] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Bohrer, Gil] Ohio State Univ, Dept Civil & Environ Engn & Geodet Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Janssens, Ivan A.; Gielen, Bert] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Rambal, Serge] CNRS, CEFE, DREAM, UMR5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Moors, Eddy] Wageningen UR, ESS CC, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Matteucci, Giorgio] Inst Agroenvironm & Forest Biol, Nat Res Council, I-00015 Monterotondo, RM, Italy";Niu, SL (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.;"Belgium; France; Italy; Netherlands; People's Republic of China; United States";"Belgium; France; Italy; Netherlands; People's Republic of China; United States";"BEL; CHN; FRA; ITA; NLD; USA";12;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;17;10;3102;3114;;10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02459.x;1354-1013;;;1354-1013;;oui;1;2011;oui;1;2011;Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175;Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175;UMR5175;UMR5175;5 - Exceptionelle

In this study, we combined datasets of satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and climatic factors to analyze spatio-temporal patterns of changes in vegetation growth and their linkage with changes in temperature and precipitation in temperate and boreal regions of Eurasia (>23.5 degrees N) from 1982 to 2006. At the continental scale, although a statistically significant positive trend of average growing season NDVI is observed (0.5 x 10(-3) year (1), P = 0.03) during the entire study period, there are two distinct periods with opposite trends in growing season NDVI. Growing season NDVI has first significantly increased from 1982 to 1997 (1.8 x 10(-3) year(-1), P < 0.001), and then decreased from 1997 to 2006 (-1.3 x 10(-3) year(-1), P = 0.055). This reversal in the growing season NDVI trends over Eurasia are largely contributed by spring and summer NDVI changes. Both spring and summer NDVI significantly increased from 1982 to 1997 (2.1 x 10(-3) year(-1), P = 0.01; 1.6 x 10(-3) year(-1) P < 0.001, respectively), but then decreased from 1997 to 2006, particularly summer NDVI which may be related to the remarkable decrease in summer precipitation ( 2.7mm yr(-1), P = 0.009). Further spatial analyses supports the idea that the vegetation greening trend in spring and summer that occurred during the earlier study period 1982-1997 was either stalled or reversed during the following study period 1997-2006.

In order to study the combined effect of temperature and UVB increase, on the phytoplankton community in the Saint Lawrence Estuary, duplicates of four different treatments were applied to 2 m(3) mesocosms to simulate an overall 3 degrees C and a 77.8% UVB increase, and combined. Samples were collected every 6 h over 10 days and the phytoplankton community was then analysed using a conventional flow cytometer and a Cytosense flow cytometer. Flow cytometry distinguished 9 clusters (Pico, Nano I, C3, C4, CHAINS, C6, C7 and C8) of cells sharing similar optical properties with average sizes varying from 1.3 mu m up to 101 mu m for chain forming cells. Compared to untreated enclosures, the high UVB treatment induced lower cell abundances (up to -40%) for clusters Pico, Nano I. C4, CHAINS and C7, followed by an unexpected cell abundance increase in all the clusters during the last 3 days of the experiment (up to 46%). This increase was sustained by faster calculated periodicities of the cell optical characteristics and abundances, linked to a shorter cell cycle. In the samples from the high temperature treatment mesocosms, a positive delay was observed for the cell abundance increase in clusters CHAINS, C6 and C8, combined with higher average abundance values (up to 67% with respect to untreated mesocosms). During the last 3 days of the experiment, abundances decreased compared to the values observed in the high UVB mesocosms, with a slower trend in the periodicities, suggesting that high temperature inhibits the cell cycle. The combined temperature and UVB treatment emphasized the effects observed under high temperature treatments, maintaining temperature positive effects (i.e. higher abundances) on clusters C3, CHAINS, C6 and C8 suggesting a compensation from the positive temperature effects over the negative (i.e. lower abundances) UVB effects. Increasing temperature induced a negative effect on the abundance of clusters C4 and C7. In this case, trends in C6 and C8 cell periodicities were faster than under normal conditions while Nano I, C4 and C7 cycles were slower. Cells<3 mu m were negatively affected by the combined exposure (up to -55% compared to untreated mesocosms) while most of the larger cells were positively affected (up to -55% compared to untreated mesocosms), suggesting a shift to an herbivorous food web (sensu Legendre and Rassoulzadegan, 1995). Results suggest that changes in cell cycles due to increases in temperature or UVB exposure may play an important role in controlling abundance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The recent Arctic sea ice decline is also characterized by a rapid thinning and by an increase of sea ice kinematics (velocities and deformation rates), with both processes being coupled through positive feedbacks. In this study we show that IPCC climate models underestimate the observed thinning trend by a factor of almost 4 on average and fail to capture the associated accelerated motion. The coupling between the ice state (thickness and concentration) and ice velocity is unexpectedly weak in most models. In particular, sea ice drifts faster during the months when it is thick and packed than when it is thin, contrary to what is observed; also models with larger long-term thinning trends do not show higher drift acceleration. This weak coupling behavior (1) suggests that the positive feedbacks mentioned above are underestimated and (2) can partly explain the models' underestimation of the recent sea ice area, thickness, and velocity trends. Due partly to this weak coupling, ice export does not play an important role in the simulated negative balance of Arctic sea ice mass between 1950 and 2050. If we assume a positive trend on ice speeds at straits equivalent to the one observed since 1979 within the Arctic basin, first-order estimations give shrinking and thinning trends that become significantly closer to the observations.";;"RHEOLOGY; DYNAMICS; FEEDBACK; COVER";"Geosciences; Plant & Animal Science";Oceanography;"[Rampal, P.; Weiss, J.] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, CNRS, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Rampal, P.; Campin, J. -M.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Dubois, C.] Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, F-31057 Toulouse, France";Rampal, P (reprint author), MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;"France; United States";"France; United States";"FRA; USA";19;JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS;;;;;116;;;;C00D07;10.1029/2011JC007110;2169-9275;2169-9291;;2169-9275 eISSN: 2169-9291;;oui;1;2011;oui;1;2011;Laboratoire de glaciologie et géophysique de l'environnement (LGGE), UMR5183;Laboratoire de glaciologie et géophysique de l'environnement (LGGE), UMR5183;UMR5183;UMR5183;0 - Sans notoriété

To predict the viability of populations, it is essential to clarify how performance depends both on large-scale environmental changes, such as climate warming, and on the local habitat. However, in spite of their potential importance, effects of interactions between large-scale environmental changes and the local environment on population viability have rarely been examined. 2. We investigated how population dynamics of the endangered alpine plant Dracocephalum austriacum depend on local habitat quality and climatic variation, as well as how effects of climate depend on local habitat. We used lasso regression shrinkage and integral projection models to identify effects on vital rates and population growth rates in seven populations over seven annual transitions. 3. Populations on steeper slopes had lower survival and stochastic population growth rate than populations on more gentle slopes. In years with low spring temperatures and high summer temperatures, survival and population growth rate were lower. In addition, the negative effects of high summer temperatures did depend on local habitat quality, being more negative in populations on steeper slopes. 4. Combining the net positive effects of high spring temperature and the net negative effects of high summer temperature on plant vital rates with predicted climate change over the next 30 years suggested that effects on D. austriacum would be relatively small. 5. Synthesis. Our results show that different aspects of a warmer climate may have opposing effects on populations, and that climatic effects may depend on local habitat quality. Such interactive effects should be accounted for when determining effects of large-scale environmental changes on population and community dynamics.;"climate change; Dracocephalum austriacum; global warming; integral projection model; local environment; plant population and community dynamics; slope; spatio-temporal variation; temperature";"INTEGRAL PROJECTION MODELS; MATRIX MODELS; EXTINCTION RISK; ENDEMIC PLANT; DYNAMICS; DEMOGRAPHY; ENVIRONMENTS; REGRESSION; CONSEQUENCES; CONSERVATION";"Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Plant Sciences; Ecology";"[Dahlgren, Johan P.; Ehrlen, Johan] Stockholm Univ, Dept Bot, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Nicole, Florence] Univ St Etienne, Univ Lyon, Lab BVpam, F-42000 St Etienne, France; [Vivat, Agnes] Pole Natura 2000, F-05600 Mt Dauphin, France; [Till-Bottraud, Irene] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble, France";Dahlgren, JP (reprint author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Bot, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.;"France; Sweden";"France; Sweden";"FRA; SWE";28;JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY;;;;;99;5;1211;1218;;10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01852.x;0022-0477;;;0022-0477;;oui;1;2011;oui;1;2011;Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553;Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553;UMR5553;UMR5553;5 - Exceptionelle

These coarse resolution studies are, however, of limited relevance for projecting risks to biodiversity in mountain systems, where pronounced microclimatic variation could allow species to persist locally, and are ill-suited for assessment of species-specific threat in particular regions. Here, we assess the impacts of climate change on 2632 plant species across all major European mountain ranges, using high-resolution (ca. 100 m) species samples and data expressing four future climate scenarios. Projected habitat loss is greater for species distributed at higher elevations; depending on the climate scenario, we find 36-55% of alpine species, 31-51% of subalpine species and 19-46% of montane species lose more than 80% of their suitable habitat by 2070-2100. While our high-resolution analyses consistently indicate marked levels of threat to cold-adapted mountain florae across Europe, they also reveal unequal distribution of this threat across the various mountain ranges. Impacts on florae from regions projected to undergo increased warming accompanied by decreased precipitation, such as the Pyrenees and the Eastern Austrian Alps, will likely be greater than on florae in regions where the increase in temperature is less pronounced and rainfall increases concomitantly, such as in the Norwegian Scandes and the Scottish Highlands. This suggests that change in precipitation, not only warming, plays an important role in determining the potential impacts of climate change on vegetation.";"alpine plants; Europe vegetation; global change; impact assessment; species distribution models";"LAND-USE CHANGE; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; PLANT-DISTRIBUTION; VASCULAR PLANTS; GLOBAL CHANGE; ALPINE PLANT; RANGE; ALPS; VEGETATION";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Engler, Robin; Pearman, Peter B.; Le Lay, Gwenaelle; Vittoz, Pascal; Guisan, Antoine] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Randin, Christophe F.] Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Thuiller, Wilfried; Albert, Cecile H.; Choler, Philippe] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UJF, Lab Ecol Alpine,UMR 5553, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Dullinger, Stefan] Vienna Inst Nat Conservat & Analyses, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Dullinger, Stefan] Univ Vienna, Dept Conservat Biol Vegetat & Landscape Ecol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Zimmermann, Niklaus E.; Pearman, Peter B.; Normand, Signe] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Araujo, Miguel B.] CSIC, Natl Museum Nat Sci, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Araujo, Miguel B.; Nogues-Bravo, David] Univ Evora, CIBIO, Rui Nabeiro Biodivers Chair, P-7000 Evora, Portugal; [Piedallu, Christian; Gegout, Jean-Claude] AgroParisTech, ENGREF, UMR1092, Lab Etude Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, FR-54000 Nancy, France; [Piedallu, Christian; Gegout, Jean-Claude] Ctr INRA Nancy, INRA, UMR1092, Lab Etude Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Choler, Philippe] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UJF, Stn Alpine J Fourier,UMS 2925, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Coldea, Gheorghe] Inst Biol Res, Dept Plant Ecol, Cluj Napoca 400015, Romania; [De Lamo, Xavier; Sebastia, Maria-Teresa] Forest Technol Ctr Catalonia, Lab Funct Ecol & Global Change, Solsona 25280, Spain; [Dirnbock, Thomas] Environm Agcy Austria, Dep Ecosyst Res & Monitoring, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Grytnes, John-Arvid] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Gomez-Garcia, Daniel] CSIC, Inst Pirenaico Ecol, Jaca 22700, Spain; [Heegaard, Einar; Hoistad, Fride] Norwegian Forest & Landscape Inst, N-5244 Fana, Norway; [Nogues-Bravo, David] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Normand, Signe] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Puscas, Mihai] Univ Babes Bolyai, A Borza Bot Garden, Cluj Napoca 400015, Romania; [Sebastia, Maria-Teresa] Univ Lleida, ETSEA, Lleida 25198, Spain; [Stanisci, Angela] Univ Molise, Envirometr Lab, I-86090 Pesche, Isernia, Italy; [Theurillat, Jean-Paul] Fdn JM Aubert, Ctr Alpien Phytogeog, CH-1938 Champex Lac, Switzerland; [Theurillat, Jean-Paul] Univ Geneva, Lab Biogeog, Biol Sect, CH-1292 Chambesy, Switzerland; [Trivedi, Mandar R.] John Krebs Field Stn, Global Canopy Programme, Oxford OX2 8QJ, England";Engler, R (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.;"Austria; Denmark; France; Italy; Norway; Portugal; Romania; Spain; Switzerland; United Kingdom";"Austria; Denmark; France; Italy; Norway; Portugal; Romania; Spain; Switzerland; United Kingdom";"AUT; CHE; DNK; ESP; FRA; GBR; ITA; NOR; PRT; ROU";122;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;17;7;2330;2341;;10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02393.x;1354-1013;1365-2486;;1354-1013 eISSN: 1365-2486;;oui;1;2011;oui;1;2011;"Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553; Station alpine Joseph Fourier (SAJF), UMS3370";"Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553; Station alpine Joseph Fourier (SAJF), UMS3370";"UMR5553; UMS3370";"UMR5553; UMS3370";5 - Exceptionelle

Sedimentation is mainly of minerogenic origin. The organic matter quantity (TOC%) as well as its quality (hydrogen (HI) and oxygen (OI) indices) both indicate the progressive onset and subsequent stabilization of vegetation cover in the catchment from 9950 to 5550 cal. BP. During this phase, the pedogenic process of carbonate dissolution is marked by a decrease in the calcium content in the sediment record. Between 7850 and 5550 cal. BP, very low manganese concentrations suggest anoxic conditions in the bottom-water of Lake Anterne. These are caused by a relatively high organic matter (terrestrial and lacustrine) content, a low flood frequency and longer summer stratification triggered by warmer conditions. From 5550 cal. BP, a decrease in TOC, stabilization of HI and higher sedimentation rates together reflect increased erosion rates of leptosols and developed soils, probably due to a colder and wetter climate. Then, three periods of important soil destabilization are marked by an increased frequency and thickness of flood deposits during the Bronze Age and by increases in topsoil erosion relative to leptosols (HI increases) during the late Iron Age/Roman period and the Medieval periods. These periods are also characterized by higher sedimentation rates. According to palynological data, human impact (deforestation and/or pasturing activity) probably triggered these periods of increased soil erosion.;"climate change; erosion; human impact; organic and mineral geochemistry; soils";"LAND-USE IMPACTS; ROCK-EVAL PYROLYSIS; SWISS ALPS; ORGANIC-MATTER; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES; SOIL DEVELOPMENT; CAL BP; M ASL; VEGETATION; RECORD";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary";"[Giguet-Covex, Charline; Arnaud, Fabien; Rey, Pierre-Jerome; Delannoy, Jean-Jacques] Univ Savoie, EDYTEM, CNRS Pole Montagne, F-73376 Le Bourget Du Lac, France; [Poulenard, Jerome] Univ Savoie, INRA, CARRTEL, F-73376 Le Bourget Du Lac, France; [Disnar, Jean-Robert] CNRS, ISTO, UMR 6113, F-75700 Paris, France; [Delhon, Claire] CNRS, CEPAM, UMR 6130, F-75700 Paris, France; [Francus, Pierre] INRS, Ctr Eau Terre & Environm, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Francus, Pierre] GEOTOP, Geochem & Geodynam Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [David, Fernand] CEREGE, Aix En Provence, France; [Enters, Dirk] Lower Saxony Inst Hist Coastal Res, Wilhelmshaven, Germany";Giguet-Covex, C (reprint author), Univ Savoie, EDYTEM, CNRS Pole Montagne, F-73376 Le Bourget Du Lac, France.;"Canada; France; Germany";"Canada; France; Germany";"CAN; DEU; FRA";28;HOLOCENE;;;;;21;4;651;665;;10.1177/0959683610391320;0959-6836;1477-0911;;0959-6836 eISSN: 1477-0911;;oui;1;2011;oui;1;2011;"Centre d'Etudes Préhistoire, Antiquité, Moyen-Age (CEPAM), UMR6130; Centre européen de recherche et d'enseignement de géosciences de l'environnement (CEREGE), UMR6635; Environnements, Dynamiques et Territoires de la Montagne (EDYTEM), UMR5204; Institut des Sciences de la Terre d'Orléans (ISTO), UMR6113";"Centre européen de recherche et d'enseignement de géosciences de l'environnement (CEREGE), UMR7330; Cultures et Environnements.

The relevant time scales can be as low as 10 min, which requires strong statistical downscaling of climate model simulation results. In this research, two sets of methods have been suggested and tested based on Belgian data. The first set makes direct use of the precipitation results of the climate models. They involve computation of quantile perturbations on extreme precipitation intensities, and the tested assumption that the same perturbations hold for daily and sub-daily time scales. The second set of methods is based on weather typing, and accounts for the low accuracy of daily precipitation results in current climate modelling. In these methods, climate model outputs on pressure (atmospheric circulation) are used to obtain precipitation estimates from analogue days in the past. Different criteria for defining analogue days have been tested. The weather typing methods have been further advanced accounting for the fact that precipitation change does not only depend on change in atmospheric circulation, but also on temperature rise. Results have been investigated as changes to precipitation intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships. It is shown that both the quantile-perturbation and advanced weather typing based methods allow precipitation biases in climate model simulation results to be largely corrected. Both types of methods moreover produce similar short-duration changes in precipitation extremes, which gives some credibility to the downscaled impacts. The corresponding changes in IDE statistics show that the extreme precipitation quantiles typically used for design of urban drainage systems, can increase up to 30% by the end of this century. Those changes mean that sewer surcharge or flooding would occur about twice more frequently than in the present climate (if no other environmental or management changes are accounted for). This would have a significant impact on future urban water management and planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Model-data fusion (MDF) is an emerging area of research in ecology and palaeoecology. It provides a new quantitative approach that offers a high level of empirical constraint over model predictions based on observations using inverse modelling and data assimilation (DA) techniques. Increasing demands to integrate model and data methods in the past decade has led to MDF utilization in palaeoecology, ecology and earth system sciences. This paper reviews key features and principles of MDF and highlights different approaches with regards to DA. After providing a critical evaluation of the numerous benefits of MDF and its current applications in palaeoecology (i.e. palaeoclimatic reconstruction, palaeovegetation and palaeocarbon storage) and ecology (i.e. parameter and uncertainty estimation, model error identification, remote sensing and ecological forecasting), the paper discusses method limitations, current challenges and future research direction.

If losses were not randomly distributed across the tree of life, climate change could lead to a disproportionate loss of evolutionary history(3-5). Here we estimate the consequences of climate change on the phylogenetic diversities of plant, bird and mammal assemblages across Europe. Using a consensus across ensembles of forecasts for 2020, 2050 and 2080 and high-resolution phylogenetic trees, we show that species vulnerability to climate change clusters weakly across phylogenies. Such phylogenetic signal in species vulnerabilities does not lead to higher loss of evolutionary history than expected with a model of random extinctions. This is because vulnerable species have neither fewer nor closer relatives than the remaining clades. Reductions in phylogenetic diversity will be greater in southern Europe, and gains are expected in regions of high latitude or altitude. However, losses will not be offset by gains and the tree of life faces a trend towards homogenization across the continent.;;"PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL; EXTINCTION RISK; BIODIVERSITY; PREDICTORS; TRAITS; NICHE";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Thuiller, Wilfried; Lavergne, Sebastien; Roquet, Cristina; Boulangeat, Isabelle; Lafourcade, Bruno] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS, UMR 5553, FR-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Araujo, Miguel.

The results suggest that between 1901 and 2002, the modeled NPP has significantly increased by 5.5-8.5 Tg C yr(-1) (15-20% growth). Such increase in NPP has caused an increased cumulated terrestrial C storage by about 5-11 Pg C. About 50-70% fraction of this total C sink is located in vegetation biomass. Our modeling results also suggest that 40-60% of the accumulate C uptake of the 20th century is credited to the period of 1980-2002. Although all models tend to agree at the continental scale that East Asia played a role of net C sink (0.14-0.18 Pg C yr(-1)) during 1980s and 1990s, the trends of NEP are different among the models. Both LPJ and ORCHIDEE estimate a slight but insignificant NEP decrease from 1980 to 2002 (P>0.05), while SDGVM estimates a statistically significant increase in NEP at a rate of 0.005 Pg C yr(-2) (P<0.05). Also, there is no consensus among models on the dominant driving factors controlling interannual variation in NPP and NEP at the continental scale, implying that more efforts are needed to investigate the vulnerability of the East Asian terrestrial carbon cycle.

Two time slices of 30 years are chosen to represent, respectively, the end of the 20th century and the middle of the 21st century. The lower-boundary conditions (sea-surface temperature and sea-ice extension) are taken from the outputs of three global coupled climate models: Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), Centre National de Recherches M,t,orologiques (CNRM) and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). Results from a two-way nesting system between LMDZ-global and LMDZ-regional are also presented. The evaluation of simulated temperature and precipitation for the current climate shows that LMDZ reproduces generally well the spatial distribution of mean climate and extreme climate events in southeast China, but the model has systematic cold biases in temperature and tends to overestimate the extreme precipitation. The two-way nesting model can reduce the cold bias to some extent compared to the one-way nesting model. Results with greenhouse gas forcing from the SRES-A2 emission scenario show that there is a significant increase for mean, daily-maximum and minimum temperature in the entire region, associated with a decrease in the number of frost days and an increase in the heat wave duration. The annual frost days are projected to significantly decrease by 12-19 days while the heat wave duration to increase by about 7 days. A warming environment gives rise to changes in extreme precipitation events. Except two simulations (LMDZ/GFDL and LMDZ/IPSL2) that project a decrease in maximum 5-day precipitation (R5d) for winter, other precipitation extremes are projected to increase over most of southeast China in all seasons, and among the three global scenarios. The domain-averaged values for annual simple daily intensity index (SDII), R5d and fraction of total rainfall from extreme events (R95t) are projected to increase by 6-7, 10-13 and 11-14%, respectively, relative to their present-day values.

Many of these impacts are mediated through direct effects of temperature on individual vital rates. Yet how this translates from the individual to the population level is still poorly understood, hampering the assessment of global warming impacts on population structure and dynamics. Here, we study the effects of temperature on intraspecific competition and cannibalism and the population dynamical consequences in a size-structured fish population. We use a physiologically structured consumer-resource model in which we explicitly model the temperature dependencies of the consumer vital rates and the resource population growth rate. Our model predicts that increased temperature decreases resource density despite higher resource growth rates, reflecting stronger intraspecific competition among consumers. At a critical temperature, the consumer population dynamics destabilize and shift from a stable equilibrium to competition-driven generation cycles that are dominated by recruits. As a consequence, maximum age decreases and the proportion of younger and smaller-sized fish increases. These model predictions support the hypothesis of decreasing mean body sizes due to increased temperatures. We conclude that in size-structured fish populations, global warming may increase competition, favor smaller size classes, and induce regime shifts that destabilize population and community dynamics.;"cannibalism; competition; global warming; population dynamics; PSPIA";"PERCA-FLUVIATILIS; EURASIAN PERCH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIFE-HISTORY; INDIVIDUAL GROWTH; BODY-SIZE; CANNIBALISM; DAPHNIA; ENVIRONMENTS; COMPETITION";"Biology & Biochemistry; Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";"[Ohlberger, Jan; Edeline, Eric; Vollestad, Leif Asbjorn; Stenseth, Nils C.] Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, CEES, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Edeline, Eric] Univ Paris 06, UMR 7618, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Lab Biogeochim & Ecol Milieux Continentaux, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Claessen, David] Ecole Normale Super, UMR 7625, Lab Ecol & Evolut, Environm Res & Teaching Inst, F-75230 Paris 05, France";Ohlberger, J (reprint author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, CEES, POB 1066 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.;"France; Norway";"France; Norway";"FRA; NOR";27;AMERICAN NATURALIST;;;;;177;2;211;223;;10.1086/657925;0003-0147;1537-5323;;0003-0147 eISSN: 1537-5323;;oui;1;2011;oui;1;2011;"Ecologie et évolution, UMR7625; Institut d'écologie et des sciences de l'environnement de Paris (IEES), UMR7618";"Institut d'écologie et des sciences de l'environnement de Paris (IEES), UMR7618; Institut de biologie de l'Ecole Normale Supérieure (IBENS), UMR8197";"UMR7618; UMR7625";"UMR7618; UMR8197";3 - Correcte

The quantitative climate reconstruction uses multiple methods to provide an improved assessment of the uncertainties involved in palaeoclimate reconstructions. The multimethod approach comprises Partial Least Squares regression, Weighted Average Partial Least Squares regression, the Modern Analogues Technique, and the Non-Metric-Multidimensional Scaling/Generalized Additive Model method. We find two distinct climate intervals during the Holocene. The first is a moist period from 9500 to 7800 cal. BP characterised by wet winters and dry summers, resulting in a strongly seasonal hydrological contrast (stronger than today) that is interrupted by a short-lived event around 8200 cal. BP. This event is characterised by wet winters and summers at Accesa whereas at Tenaghi Philippon the signal is stronger, reversing the established seasonal pattern, with dry winters and wet summers. The second interval represents a later aridification phase, with a reduced seasonal contrast and lower overall precipitation, lasting from 7800 to 5000 cal. BP. Present-day Mediterranean conditions were established between 2500 and 2000 cal. BP. Many studies show the Holocene to have a complex pattern of climatic change across the Mediterranean regions. Our results confirm the traditional understanding of an evolution from wetter (early Holocene) to drier climatic conditions (late Holocene), but highlight the role of changing seasonality during this time. Our data yield new insights into the aspect of seasonality changes, and explain the apparent discrepancies between the previously available climate information based on pollen, lake-levels and isotopes by invoking changes in precipitation seasonality.;"climate changes; Holocene; Mediterranean; pollen; seasonality";"LAGO-DELLACCESA TUSCANY; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; CLIMATIC CHANGES; HUMAN IMPACT; VEGETATION DYNAMICS; NEOLITHIC TRANSITION; MIDHOLOCENE CLIMATE; LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS; MILLENNIAL-SCALE; SOUTHERN SPAIN";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary";"[Peyron, Odile] Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, Lab Chronoenvironm, UMR 6249, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Goring, Simon] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Kotthoff, Ulrich; Pross, Joerg] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-6000 Frankfurt, Germany; [Kotthoff, Ulrich] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [de Beaulieu, Jacques-Louis] Univ Paul Cezanne Europole Arbois, Puyricard, France; [Drescher-Schneider, Ruth] Kainbach Bei Graz, Graz, Austria";Peyron, O (reprint author), Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, Lab Chronoenvironm, UMR 6249, 16 Route Gray, F-25030 Besancon, France.;"Austria; Canada; France; Germany";"Austria; Canada; France; Germany";"AUT; CAN; DEU; FRA";67;HOLOCENE;;;;;21;1;131;146;;10.1177/0959683610384162;0959-6836;;;0959-6836;;oui;1;2011;oui;1;2011;Chrono-environnement, UMR6249;Chrono-environnement, UMR6249;UMR6249;UMR6249;3 - Correcte

The sediment was described by a three end-member system comprising Blue Nile (BN; Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7506; Sr = 210 ppm), White Nile (WN; Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7094; Sr = 72.5 ppm) and Saharan dust (SD; Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7183; Sr = 99 ppm). The sedimentary record of these cores represents the suspended load carried down the Nile river and discharged into the S.E. Levantine basin and thus records palaeoclimatically controlled changes in erosion and transport in the catchment. During arid periods (0-5 ka BP) and prior to 11 ka BP, fluxes of BN sediment at 9509 (similar to 6 g/cm(2)/yr & 10-12 g/cm(2)/yr, respectively) were greater than during the peak of the African Humid Period (AHP) from 5 to 11 ka BP (<2 g/cm(2)/yr); this latter period witnessed the deposition of the youngest organic-rich sediment, termed sapropel (S-1), in the EM basin. By contrast the flux of WN increased during the AHP from similar to 5 g/cm(2)/yr at similar to 13 ka BP to >15 g/cm(2)/yr. In the Ethiopian Highlands (BN catchment) increases in the amount and duration of the monsoon during the AHP caused more vegetation to grow resulting in less soil erosion. In the WN catchment increased rainfall caused more catchment erosion and higher sediment flux through the Sudd marshes. The sedimentation rate in core 9509 increased during the AHP because of the greater importance of the WN sediment flux relative to the BN sediment flux. Saharan dust flux also decreased during the AHP reaching a minimum at similar to 6 ka BP (core 9509) due to 'greening' of the Sahara desert. At the onset of S-1, the changes in Nile flow as determined by Sr-87/Sr-86 and climatic changes in the EM basin determined by delta O-18 of planktonic foraminifera were simultaneous, confirming that such isotopic tracers cannot be used directly to determine the cause of the circulation changes in the EM at this time. The increase in the proportion of BN sediment at 9509 with a somewhat higher grain size during the H-1 period (15-17 ka BP) was caused by erosion and redistribution of sediment from the Nile delta and/or the Israeli coast as sea-level rose.

Variability of both time-series display 3 significant frequency-bands (peaks significant at the 5% level): (1) a low-frequency-band (multi-decadal) with a 25 yr peak period, (2) a 3 to 8 yr band period (inter-annual) with a 3.1 yr peak period, and (3) a 2 to 3 yr band period (quasi-biennial) with a 2.4 yr peak period. Joint sea surface temperature/sea level pressure (SST/SLP) EOF analyses based on data from the 20th century along with spatio-temporal patterns for the above frequency-bands, are presented. SST anomalies were found to display early significant spatial SST patterns in the north Atlantic ocean (air temperature lagging by 6 mo) similar to those obtained from EOF analyses. It is proposed that the robust power spectra for the above frequency-bands are linked with Atlantic climate variability modulating western European climate: (1) the global Multi-Decadal Oscillation (MDO) with its Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) footprint, (2) the Atlantic Inter-Annual (IA) fluctuations, and (3) the Atlantic Quasi-Biennial (QB) fluctuations. Moreover these specific western European climate signals are perceived as contributors to the timing of GHD in Burgundy. Thus, advance knowledge on the evolution and phasing of the above climate fluctuations become important elements for viticulture and wine industry management, since anthropogenic effects could have modified time-series patterns, particularly since the mid-1980s.;"Western European climate variability; Climate change; Grape harvest dates; Pinot noir; Burgundy; GHD";"ATLANTIC MULTIDECADAL OSCILLATION; CENTRAL ENGLAND TEMPERATURES; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; RECONSTRUCTION; CENTURIES; AD";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Tourre, Yves M.] Meteo France, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Tourre, Yves M.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Geol Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Rousseau, Daniel] Conseil Super Meteorol, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Jarlan, Lionel] Ctr Etud Spatiales BIOsphere IRD CESBIO, Inst Rech Dev, F-31401 Toulouse, France; [Ladurie, Emmanuel Le Roy] Coll France, F-75005 Paris, France; [Daux, Valerie] LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France";Tourre, YM (reprint author), Meteo France, F-31057 Toulouse, France.;"France; United States";"France; United States";"FRA; USA";3;CLIMATE RESEARCH;;;;;46;3;243;253;;10.3354/cr00991;0936-577X;;;0936-577X;;oui;1;2011;oui;1;2011;"Centre d'études spatiales de la biosphère (CESBIO), UMR5126; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"Centre d'études spatiales de la biosphère (CESBIO), UMR5126; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"UMR5126; UMR8212";"UMR5126; UMR8212";2 - Acceptable

Batch cultures were grown under 4 conditions: 400 mu atm and 19 degrees C; 400 mu atm and 22 degrees C; 740 mu atm and 19 degrees C; and 740 mu atm and 22 degrees C. The growth rate (mu) significantly increased under elevated pCO(2) only in the haploid stage and showed a different pattern with respect to temperature: it was higher at an elevated temperature in the haploid stage at 400 mu atm whereas it decreased in the diploid stage at 740 mu atm. Increasing both parameters together increased the growth rate by 11 % in the haploid stage only. Elevated pCO(2) had a negative impact on the content of particulate organic carbon (POC), production and cell size in both life stages at 19 degrees C, while no significant effect was observed at 22 degrees C. Increasing temperature significantly increased the content of POC and production in the diploid stage at 740 mu atm, while at 400 mu atm it significantly decreased both the content of POC and production in the haploid stage.

Seven of these are considered to be reliable and indicate a geomagnetic field strength of about 30 mu T. This value is some 75% of the present geomagnetic field strength but is in agreement with the absolute intensities predicted from global models for this time and location, and consistent with coeval published determinations. These data thus provide significant evidence for the geomagnetic field strength in an area and for a time that was previously poorly constrained, thus providing an important contribution towards establishing a local master curve for the last 3500 yr. When established, such a curve would be a useful dating tool and also enable establishing for field strength correlations with climatic events and civilization evolutions in a region that is particularly strong in archeological and geological features. Such potential is examined for aridity events, although such observations can only be considered tentative at this stage. (c) 2012 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

There is substantial evidence to show that temperature governs the growth, survival, and maturation of salmon during their marine migrations through either direct or indirect effects. In an earlier study (2003), long-term changes in three trophic levels (salmon, zooplankton, and phytoplankton) were shown to be correlated significantly with sea surface temperature (SST) and northern hemisphere temperature (NHT). A sequence of trophic changes ending with a stepwise decline in the total nominal catch of North Atlantic salmon (regime shift in similar to 1986/1987) was superimposed on a trend to a warmer dynamic regime. Here, the earlier study is updated with catch and abundance data to 2010, confirming earlier results and detecting a new abrupt shift in similar to 1996/1997. Although correlations between changes in salmon, plankton, and temperature are reinforced, the significance of the correlations is reduced because the temporal autocorrelation of time-series substantially increased due to a monotonic trend in the time-series, probably related to global warming. This effect may complicate future detection of effects of climate change on natural systems.;"Climate change; North Atlantic; northern hemisphere temperature; plankton; regime shift; salmon; sea surface temperature";"CLIMATE-CHANGE; REGIME SHIFT; WATER TEMPERATURE; SEA; OCEAN; SALAR; GROWTH; RIVER; CONSEQUENCES; ZOOPLANKTON";"Geosciences; Plant & Animal Science";"Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography";"[Reid, Philip C.] Sir Alister Hardy Fdn Ocean Sci, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England; [Reid, Philip C.] Univ Plymouth, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Reid, Philip C.] Marine Biol Assoc UK, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England; [Beaugrand, Gregory] Univ Sci & Technol Lille, CNRS, F-62930 Wimereux, France";Reid, PC (reprint author), Sir Alister Hardy Fdn Ocean Sci, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England.;"France; United Kingdom";"France; United Kingdom";"FRA; GBR";14;ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE;;;;;69;9;1549;1562;;10.1093/icesjms/fss153;1054-3139;1095-9289;;1054-3139 eISSN: 1095-9289;;oui;1;2012;oui;1;2012;Laboratoire d'océanologie et de géosciences (LOG), UMR8187;Laboratoire d'océanologie et de géosciences (LOG), UMR8187;UMR8187;UMR8187;4 - Excellente

Climate-induced changes in decapods have played an important role. Here, we reveal a coincident increase in the abundance of swimming crabs and lesser black-backed gull colonies in the North Sea, both in time and in space. Swimming crabs are an important food source for lesser black-backed gulls during the breeding season. Inhabiting the land, but feeding mainly at sea, lesser black-backed gulls provide a link between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, since the bottom-up influence of allochthonous nutrient input from seabirds to coastal soils can structure the terrestrial food web. We, therefore, suggest that climate-driven changes in trophic interactions in the marine food web may also have ensuing ramifications for the coastal ecology of the North Sea.;"climate change; food web; Larus fuscus graelsii; plankton; Polybius henslowii; sea temperature";"TROPHIC AMPLIFICATION; LARUS-ARGENTATUS; CLIMATE; SEABIRD; COMMUNITIES; FUSCUS";"Biology & Biochemistry; Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";"[Kirby, R.

Forecasting these changes and designing adequate management of future ecosystem services will require predictive models encompassing the most fundamental biotic responses. However, most present models omit important processes such as evolution and competition(4,5). Here we develop a spatially explicit eco-evolutionary model of multi-species responses to climate change. We demonstrate that both dispersal and evolution differentially mediate extinction risks and biodiversity alterations through time and across climate gradients. Together, high genetic variance and low dispersal best minimized extinction risks. Surprisingly, high dispersal did not reduce extinctions, because the shifting ranges of some species hastened the decline of others. Evolutionary responses dominated during the later stages of climatic changes and in hot regions. No extinctions occurred without competition, which highlights the importance of including species interactions in global biodiversity models. Most notably, climate change created extinction and evolutionary debts, with changes in species richness and traits occuring long after climate stabilization. Therefore, even if we halt anthropogenic climate change today, transient eco-evolutionary dynamics would ensure centuries of additional alterations in global biodiversity.;;"SPECIES INTERACTIONS; RANGE SHIFTS; NICHE; ENVIRONMENTS; COMPETITION; ADAPTATION; IMPACTS; LIMITS";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Norberg, Jon] Stockholm Univ, Dept Syst Ecol, S-11429 Stockholm, Sweden; [Norberg, Jon] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-11429 Stockholm, Sweden; [Urban, Mark C.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Vellend, Mark] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Klausmeier, Christopher A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Klausmeier, Christopher A.] Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Loeuille, Nicolas] Univ Paris 06, Lab Ecol & Evolut, INRA, Ecol Populat & Communautes USC2031,UMR 7625, F-75252 Paris 05, France";Norberg, J (reprint author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Syst Ecol, 10697 Kraftriket 9A, S-11429 Stockholm, Sweden.;"Canada; France; Sweden; United States";"Canada; France; Sweden; United States";"CAN; FRA; SWE; USA";36;NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE;;;;;2;10;747;751;;10.1038/NCLIMATE1588;1758-678X;;;1758-678X;;oui;1;2012;oui;1;2012;Ecologie et évolution, UMR7625;Institut d'écologie et des sciences de l'environnement de Paris (IEES), UMR7618;UMR7625;UMR7618;5 - Exceptionelle

Two time periods were selected: 1970-1979 and 2031-2040. The WRF model driven by ERA-INTERIM reanalysis data was validated against in situ surface temperature observations. The daily maximum and minimum surface temperature (T-max and T-min) were simulated by the WRF model at 8 x 8 km horizontal resolution. The averaged daily T-max for each month during 1970-1979 have good agreement with observations, the averaged daily T-min have a warm bias about 1-2 K. The daily T-max and T-min for each month (domain averaged) during 2031-2040 show a general increase. The largest increment (similar to 3 K) was found in summer. The smallest increments (< 1 K) were found in spring and fall. The spatial distribution of temperature increment shows a strong meridional gradient, high in south in summer, reversing in winter. The resulting potential warming rate in summer is equivalent to 4.7 K/century under the IPCC A2 emission scenario. The dynamically downscaled T-max and T-min were used to simulate the grape (Pinot noir grape variety) flowering and v,raison dates. For 2031-2040, the projected dates are 8 and 12 days earlier than those during 1970-1979, respectively. The simulated hot days increase more than 50% in the two principal grapevine regions.

These landscapes have also been affected by glacial advances and retreats, causing alpine taxa to undergo range shifts and demographic changes. These nonequilibrium population dynamics have the potential to obscure the effects of environmental factors on the distribution of genetic variation. Here, we investigate how demographic change and environmental factors influence genetic variation in the alpine butterfly Colias behrii. Data from 14 microsatellite loci provide evidence of bottlenecks in all population samples. We test several alternative models of demography using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), with the results favouring a model in which a recent bottleneck precedes rapid population growth. Applying independent calibrations to microsatellite loci and a nuclear gene, we estimate that this bottleneck affected both northern and southern populations 531281 years ago, coinciding with a period of global cooling. Using regression approaches, we attempt to separate the effects of population structure, geographical distance and landscape on patterns of population genetic differentiation. Only 40% of the variation in FST is explained by these models, with geographical distance and least-cost distance among meadow patches selected as the best predictors. Various measures of genetic diversity within populations are also decoupled from estimates of local abundance and habitat patch characteristics. Our results demonstrate that demographic change can have a disproportionate influence on genetic diversity in alpine species, contrasting with other studies that suggest landscape features control contemporary demographic processes in high-elevation environments.;"approximate Bayesian computation; climate change; demographic change; landscape genetics; Matthes glaciations; Sierra Nevada";"EFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZE; ALLELE FREQUENCY DATA; SIERRA-NEVADA; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; PARNASSIUS-SMINTHEUS; MICROSATELLITE LOCI; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; ECOLOGY; DIVERGENCE; CALIFORNIA";"Biology & Biochemistry; Environment/Ecology; Molecular Biology & Genetics; Plant & Animal Science";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";"[Schoville, Sean D.; Lam, Athena W.; Roderick, George K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA";Schoville, SD (reprint author), Univ Grenoble 1, Equipe Biol Computat & Math, Lab TIMC IMAG, UMR CNRS 5525, F-38402 Grenoble, France.;"France; United States";"France; United States";"FRA; USA";3;MOLECULAR ECOLOGY;;;;;21;17;4242;4256;;10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05696.x;0962-1083;;;0962-1083;;oui;1;2012;oui;1;2012;Techniques de l'Ingénierie Médicale et de la Complexité - Informatique, Mathématiques et Applications de Grenoble (TIMC-IMAG), UMR5525;Techniques de l'Ingénierie Médicale et de la Complexité - Informatique, Mathématiques et Applications de Grenoble (TIMC-IMAG), UMR5525;UMR5525;UMR5525;5 - Exceptionelle

We show that, during the last decade (2000s), atmospheric and sea surface temperatures are reaching levels last encountered millennia ago, when northern high latitude summer insolation was higher due to a different orbital configuration. Records from lake sediments in southern Greenland document major environmental and climatic conditions during the last 10,000 years, highlighting the role of soil dynamics in past vegetation changes, and stressing the growing anthropogenic impacts on soil erosion during the recent decades. Furthermore, past and present changes in atmospheric and oceanic heat advection appear to strongly influence both regional climate and ice sheet dynamics. Projections from climate models are investigated to quantify the magnitude and rates of future changes in Greenland temperature, which may be faster than past abrupt events occurring under interglacial conditions. Within one century, in response to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, Greenland may reach temperatures last time encountered during the last interglacial period, approximately 125,000 years ago. We review and discuss whether analogies between the last interglacial and future changes are reasonable, because of the different seasonal impacts of orbital and greenhouse gas forcings. Over several decades to centuries, future Greenland melt may act as a negative feedback, limiting regional warming albeit with global sea level and climatic impacts.

This flux of warm and salty water from the Indian to the Atlantic Ocean (the Agulhas leakage) is now recognized as a key element in global climate(3). An Agulhas leakage shutdown has been associated with extreme glacial periods(4), whereas a vigorous increase has preceded shifts towards interglacials(5). In the absence of a coherent observing system, studies of the Agulhas have relied heavily on ocean models, which have revealed a possible recent increase in Agulhas leakage(6-8). However, owing to the high levels of oceanic turbulence, model solutions of the region are highly sensitive to their numerical choices(9,10), stressing the need for observations to confirm these important model results. Here, using satellite altimetry observations from 1993 to 2009, we show that the mesoscale variability of the Agulhas system, in particular in the Mozambique Channel and south of Madagascar, has intensified. This seems to result from an increased South Equatorial Current driven by enhanced trade winds over the tropical Indian Ocean. Overall, the intensified mesoscale variability of the Agulhas system is reflected in accelerated eddy propagation, in its source regions as well as the retroflection from which eddies propagate into the South Atlantic Ocean. This suggests that the Agulhas leakage may have increased from 1993 to 2009, confirming previous modelling studies that have further implied an increased Agulhas leakage may compensate a deceleration of meridional overturning circulation associated with a freshening of the North Atlantic Ocean(6,11).;;"ADVECTION SCHEMES; SOUTH ATLANTIC; CIRCULATION; CLIMATE; EXCHANGE; EDDIES; HEAT";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Backeberg, Bjoern C.; Rouault, Mathieu] Univ Cape Town, Nansen Tutu Ctr Marine Environm Res, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Backeberg, Bjoern C.; Penven, Pierrick; Rouault, Mathieu] Univ Cape Town, MA RE Inst, Dept Oceanog, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Penven, Pierrick] UBO, CNRS, IRD, IFREMER,UMR 6523,LMI ICEMASA,Lab Phys Oceans, F-29280 Plouzane, France";Backeberg, BC (reprint author), Univ Cape Town, Nansen Tutu Ctr Marine Environm Res, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.;"France; South Africa";"France; South Africa";"FRA; ZAF";15;NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE;;;;;2;8;608;612;;10.1038/NCLIMATE1587;1758-678X;1758-6798;;1758-678X eISSN: 1758-6798;;oui;1;2012;oui;1;2012;Laboratoire de physique des océans (LPO), UMR6523;Laboratoire de physique des océans (LPO), UMR6523;UMR6523;UMR6523;5 - Exceptionelle

Here, we use a hybrid model(4) that combines such projections with simulations of demography and seed dispersal to forecast the climate-driven spatio-temporal dynamics of 150 high-mountain plant species across the European Alps. This model predicts average range size reductions of 44-50% by the end of the twenty-first century, which is similar to projections from the most 'optimistic' static model (49%). However, the hybrid model also indicates that population dynamics will lag behind climatic trends and that an average of 40% of the range still occupied at the end of the twenty-first century will have become climatically unsuitable for the respective species, creating an extinction debt(5,6). Alarmingly, species endemic to the Alps seem to face the highest range losses. These results caution against optimistic conclusions from moderate range size reductions observed during the twenty-first century as they are likely to belie more severe longer-term effects of climate warming on mountain plants.;;"CHANGE IMPACTS; BIODIVERSITY; DISTRIBUTIONS; VEGETATION; DIVERSITY; ELEVATION; EUROPE; MODELS; SHIFTS; ALPS";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Dullinger, Stefan; Gattringer, Andreas; Moser, Dietmar; Willner, Wolfgang; Plutzar, Christoph; Mang, Thomas; Huelber, Karl] Vienna Inst Nat Conservat & Anal, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Dullinger, Stefan; Mang, Thomas; Ertl, Siegrun] Univ Vienna, Fac Ctr Biodivers, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine, UMR 5553, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Zimmermann, Niklaus E.; Psomas, Achilleas; Schmatz, Dirk R.] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Landscape Dynam Unit, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Guisan, Antoine; Vittoz, Pascal] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Plutzar, Christoph] Alpen Adria Univ, Inst Social Ecol Vienna SEC, A-1070 Vienna, Austria; [Leitner, Michael] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Leitner, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, FRM 2, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Caccianiga, Marco] Univ Milan, Dept Biol, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Dirnboeck, Thomas] Environm Agcy Austria, Dept Ecosyst Res & Monitoring, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Fischer, Anton] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Life & Food Sci, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Lenoir, Jonathan; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ecoinformat & Biodivers Grp, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Lenoir, Jonathan] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises EA4698, F-80037 Amiens, France; [Silc, Urban] Inst Biol Zrc Sazu, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia";Dullinger, S (reprint author), Vienna Inst Nat Conservat & Anal, Giessergasse 6-7, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.;"Austria; Denmark; France; Germany; Italy; Slovenia; Switzerland";"Austria; Denmark; France; Germany; Italy; Slovenia; Switzerland";"AUT; CHE; DEU; DNK; FRA; ITA; SVN";95;NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE;;;;;2;8;619;622;;10.1038/NCLIMATE1514;1758-678X;;;1758-678X;;oui;1;2012;oui;1;2012;Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553;Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553;UMR5553;UMR5553;5 - Exceptionelle

Here, we studied distribution patterns of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) in response to environmental variation, in 13 alpine plant species consistently sampled across the entire European Alps. Multiple linear regressions were performed between AFLP allele frequencies per site as dependent variables and two categories of independent variables, namely Morans eigenvector map MEM variables (to account for spatial and unaccounted environmental variation, and historical demographic processes) and environmental variables. These associations allowed the identification of 153 loci of ecological relevance. Univariate regressions between allele frequency and each environmental factor further showed that loci of ecological relevance were mainly correlated with MEM variables. We found that precipitation and temperature were the best environmental predictors, whereas topographic factors were rarely involved in environmental associations. Climatic factors, subject to rapid variation as a result of the current global warming, are known to strongly influence the fate of alpine plants. Our study shows, for the first time for a large number of species, that the same environmental variables are drivers of plant adaptation at the scale of a whole biome, here the European Alps.;"adaptation; climate change; environmental association analysis; genome scan; landscape genetics; loci of ecological relevance";"CLIMATE-CHANGE; LANDSCAPE GENETICS; ECOLOGICAL RESPONSES; POPULATION GENOMICS; NEIGHBOR MATRICES; SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; ARABIS-ALPINA; ADAPTATION; EVOLUTIONARY; DIVERSITY";"Biology & Biochemistry; Environment/Ecology; Molecular Biology & Genetics; Plant & Animal Science";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";"[Manel, Stephanie] Aix Marseille Univ, Lab Populat Environm Dev, UMR UP IRD 151, F-13331 Marseille 03, France; [Manel, Stephanie; Thuiller, Wilfried; Gielly, Ludovic; Taberlet, Pierre] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, CNRS UMR 5553, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Gugerli, Felix; Holderegger, Rolf] WSL Swiss Fed Res Inst, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Alvarez, Nadir] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Legendre, Pierre] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada";Manel, S (reprint author), Aix Marseille Univ, Lab Populat Environm Dev, UMR UP IRD 151, 3 Pl Victor Hugo, F-13331 Marseille 03, France.;"Canada; France; Switzerland";"Canada; France; Switzerland";"CAN; CHE; FRA";33;MOLECULAR ECOLOGY;;;;;21;15;3729;3738;;10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05656.x;0962-1083;;;0962-1083;;oui;1;2012;oui;1;2012;Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553;Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553;UMR5553;UMR5553;5 - Exceptionelle

Being globally important stocks of organic carbon, peatlands may be less sensitive to burning in comparison with upland forests, especially wet unforested ombrotrophic ecosystems as found in northeastern Canada. We aimed to determine if peatland fires have driven carbon accumulation patterns during the Holocene. To cover spatial variability, six cores from three peatlands in the Eastmain region of Quebec were analyzed for stratigraphic charcoal accumulation. Results show that regional Holocene peatland fire frequency was similar to 2.4 fires 1000 yr(-1), showing a gradually declining trend since 4000 cal yr BP, although inter- and intra-peatland variability was very high. Charcoal peak magnitudes, however, were significantly higher between 1400 and 400 cal yr BP, possibly reflecting higher charcoal production driven by differential climatic forcing aspects. Carbon accumulation rates generally declined towards the late-Holocene with minimum values of similar to 10 g m(-2) r(-1) around 1500 cal yr BP. The absence of a clear correlation between peatland fire regimes and carbon accumulation indicates that fire regimes have not been a driving factor on carbon sequestration at the millennial time scale.

Here, we present two well-resolved records from the Nile delta (based on similar to 320 radiocarbon dates) to reconstruct the timing and rhythm of catchment-scale modifications during the past 8000 years. On the orbital timescale, we demonstrate that Nilotic hydrology and sedimentation have responded to low-latitude insolation forcing while, on sub-millennial timescales, many of the major phases of deltaic modification were mediated by climate events linked to El Nino Southern Oscillation-type (ENSO) variability.

Previous studies in the Gironde estuary have reported an increase in water temperature and an extended seawater intrusion associated to global changes. In this study, we evaluated whether these changes impact the nursery function in the middle part of the system, based on the analyses of long-term data series (1991-2009) collected in that area. Trend analysis, correlations and generalized additive models (GAM) were computed in order to study the influence of water temperature and salinity changes on marine juveniles occurrence/densities. Results showed that densities of all the studied species (i.e. Engraulis encrasicolus, Sprattus sprattus, Dicentrarchus labrax, Solea solea, Argyrosomus regius, Merlangius merlangus) significantly increased over the period considered. Changes in water temperature and seawater intrusion contributed to explain the variability in presence/absence and in densities of the majority of these species. However, the deviance explained by GAM and the relevance of these two explanatory variables differed considerably according to species. For most species, it was suggested that the interaction of these two factors, and their effects on other variables, may explain the increase in abundance in the middle part of the Gironde. The effects of global changes in this estuarine system may favour its nursery function for marine juveniles, but some evidence of effects at a wider scale (community and ecosystem levels) may alter the structure and functioning of this system.

Yet, in the Southern Ocean the role of water masses in the uptake of anthropogenic carbon is still debated. Here, a methodology is applied that tracks the carbon flux of each Southern Ocean water mass in response to climate change. A global marine biogeochemical model was coupled to a climate model, making 140-yr Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5)-type simulations, where atmospheric CO2 increased by 1% yr(-1) to 4 times the preindustrial concentration (4 x CO2). Impacts of atmospheric CO2 (carbon-induced sensitivity) and climate change (climate-induced sensitivity) on the water mass carbon fluxes have been isolated performing two sensitivity simulations. In the first simulation, the atmospheric CO2 influences solely the marine carbon cycle, while in the second simulation, it influences both the marine carbon cycle and earth's climate. At 4 x CO2, the cumulative carbon uptake by the Southern Ocean reaches 278 PgC, 53% of which is taken up by modal and intermediate water masses. The carbon-induced and climate-induced sensitivities vary significantly between the water masses. The carbon-induced sensitivities enhance the carbon uptake of the water masses, particularly for the denser classes. But, enhancement strongly depends on the water mass structure. The climate-induced sensitivities either strengthen or weaken the carbon uptake and are influenced by local processes through changes in CO2 solubility and stratification, and by large-scale changes in outcrop surface (OS) areas. Changes in OS areas account for 45% of the climate-induced reduction in the Southern Ocean carbon uptake and are a key factor in understanding the future carbon uptake of the Southern Ocean.;;"GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODELS; CARBON-CYCLE; TRANSPORT; SINK; FRAMEWORK; DIOXIDE; EDDIES; SYSTEM";Geosciences;Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences;"[Seferian, Roland; Bopp, Laurent; Roy, Tilla] IPSL, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Seferian, Roland] CNRS, Meteofrance, CNRM GAME, Toulouse, France; [Iudicone, Daniele] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Naples, Italy; [Madec, Gurvan] NOC, Southampton, Hants, England; [Madec, Gurvan] LOCEAN, IPSL, Paris, France";Seferian, R (reprint author), IPSL, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Batiment 712, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.;"France; Italy; United Kingdom";"France; Italy; United Kingdom";"FRA; GBR; ITA";11;JOURNAL OF CLIMATE;;;;;25;11;3894;3908;;10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00291.1;0894-8755;;;0894-8755;;oui;1;2012;oui;1;2012;"Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), URA1357; Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire d'Océanographie et du Climat : Expérimentations et Approches Numériques (LOCEAN), UMR7159; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), UMR3589; Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire d'Océanographie et du Climat : Expérimentations et Approches Numériques (LOCEAN), UMR7159; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"FR636; UMR7159; UMR8212; URA1357";"FR636; UMR3589; UMR7159; UMR8212";4 - Excellente

Tree radial growth and carbon and oxygen stable isotope composition of latewood (d13CLW and d18OLW, respectively) from 1967 to 2007 were measured in P. halepensis trees from two sharply contrasting stand types: open woodlands with widely scattered trees versus dense afforested stands. In both stand types, tree radial growth, delta C-13(LW) and delta O-18(LW) were strongly correlated with annual rainfall, thus indicating that tree performance in this semiarid environment is largely determined by inter-annual changes in water availability. However, trees in dense afforested stands showed consistently higher delta O-18(LW) and similar delta C-13(LW) values compared with those in neighbouring open woodlands, indicating lower stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rates in the former, but little difference in water use efficiency between stand types. Trees in dense afforested stands were more water stressed and showed lower radial growth, overall suggesting greater vulnerability to drought and climate aridification compared with trees in open woodlands. In this semiarid ecosystem, the negative impacts of intense inter-tree competition for water on P. halepensis performance clearly outweigh potential benefits derived from enhanced infiltration and reduced run-off losses in dense afforested stands.;"d13C; d18O; climate change; competition; plant-climate interactions; stomatal conductance; tree-ring; water use efficiency";"OXYGEN-ISOTOPE SIGNALS; TREE MORTALITY-RATES; STABLE OXYGEN; PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES; WATER RELATIONS; GROWTH DECLINE; UNITED-STATES; LOBLOLLY-PINE; GAS-EXCHANGE; RING WIDTH";Plant & Animal Science;Plant Sciences;"[Moreno-Gutierrez, Cristina; Nicolas, Emilio; Contreras, Sergio; Ignacio Querejeta, Jose] Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura CEBAS CSIC, Murcia 30100, Spain; [Battipaglia, Giovanna] Ecole Prat Hautes Etud, Paleoenvironm & Chronoecol PALECO EPHE, Inst Bot, F-34090 Montpellier, France; [Battipaglia, Giovanna] Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Bot, Ctr Bioarcheol & Ecol, UMR5059, F-34090 Montpellier, France; [Moreno-Gutierrez, Cristina; Battipaglia, Giovanna; Cherubini, Paolo] WSL Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Saurer, Matthias] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland";Moreno-Gutierrez, C (reprint author), Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura CEBAS CSIC, Campus Univ Espinardo,POB 164, Murcia 30100, Spain.;"France; Spain; Switzerland";"France; Spain; Switzerland";"CHE; ESP; FRA";18;PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT;;;;;35;6;1026;1039;;10.1111/j.1365-3040.2011.02469.x;0140-7791;;;0140-7791;;oui;1;2012;oui;1;2012;Centre de bio-archéologie et d'écologie (CBAE), UMR5059;Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier (ISEM), UMR5554;UMR5059;UMR5554;5 - Exceptionelle

The global temperature increase will promote changes in the hydrologic cycle through redistributions of rainfall patterns and continental vegetation cover(1,2). All of these changes will impact the chemical weathering of continental rocks. Long considered an inert CO2 consumption flux at the century timescale, recent works have demonstrated its potential high sensitivity to the ongoing climate and land-use changes(3,4). Here we show that the CO2 consumption flux related to weathering processes increases by more than 50% for an atmospheric CO2 doubling for one of the most important Arctic watersheds: the Mackenzie River Basin. This result has been obtained using a process-based model of the chemical weathering of continental surfaces forced by models describing the atmospheric general circulation and the dynamic of the vegetation(5,6) under increased, atmospheric CO2.

Here, we show how changes in stratospheric circulation could play a significant role in future climate change in the extratropics through an additional shift in the tropospheric circulation. This shift in the circulation alters climate change in regional winter rainfall by an amount large enough to significantly alter regional climate change projections. The changes are consistent with changes in stratospheric winds inducing a change in the baroclinic eddy growth rate across the depth of the troposphere. A change in mean wind structure and an equatorward shift of the tropospheric storm tracks relative to models with poor stratospheric resolution allows coupling with surface climate. Using the Atlantic storm track as an example, we show how this can double the predicted increase in extreme winter rainfall over Western and Central Europe compared to other current climate projections.;"Climate change; Europe; Stratosphere; Storm track";"GRAVITY-WAVE PARAMETERIZATION; ENVIRONMENTAL-MODEL HADGEM1; GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; CYCLONE ACTIVITY; SIMULATIONS; ATMOSPHERE; ENSEMBLE; WINTER";Geosciences;Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences;"[Scaife, Adam A.; Fereday, David R.; Butchart, Neal; Hardiman, Steven C.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Spangehl, Thomas; Cubasch, Ulrich; Langematz, Ulrike] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Akiyoshi, Hideharu] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Bekki, Slimane] CNRS INSU, UPMC, UVSQ, LATMOS IPSL, Paris, France; [Braesicke, Peter] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Chipperfield, Martyn P.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Gettelman, Andrew] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Michou, Martine] CNRS, GAME CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Rozanov, Eugene] ETHZ, Davos, Switzerland; [Rozanov, Eugene] PMOD WRC, Davos, Switzerland; [Shepherd, Theodore G.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada";Scaife, AA (reprint author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England.;"Canada; France; Germany; Japan; Switzerland; United Kingdom; United States";"Canada; France; Germany; Japan; Switzerland; United Kingdom; United States";"CAN; CHE; DEU; FRA; GBR; JPN; USA";45;CLIMATE DYNAMICS;;;;;38;9-10;2089;2097;;10.1007/s00382-011-1080-7;0930-7575;1432-0894;;0930-7575 eISSN: 1432-0894;;oui;1;2012;oui;1;2012;"Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), URA1357; Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire Atmosphères, Milieux, Observations Spatiales (LATMOS), UMR8190";"Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), UMR3589; Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire Atmosphères, Milieux, Observations Spatiales (LATMOS), UMR8190";"FR636; UMR8190; URA1357";"FR636; UMR3589; UMR8190";4 - Excellente

Although appealing, these models ignore the genetic structure of species, and the fact that different populations might respond in different ways because of adaptation to their environment. Here, we introduced ancestry distribution models, that is, statistical models of the spatial distribution of ancestry proportions, for forecasting intra-specific changes based on genetic admixture instead of species occurrence data. Using multi-locus genotypes and extensive geographic coverage of distribution data across the European Alps, we applied this approach to 20 alpine plant species considering a global increase in temperature from 0.25 to 4 degrees C. We forecasted the magnitudes of displacement of contact zones between plant populations potentially adapted to warmer environments and other populations. While a global trend of movement in a north-east direction was predicted, the magnitude of displacement was species-specific. For a temperature increase of 2 degrees C, contact zones were predicted to move by 92 km on average (minimum of 5 km, maximum of 212 km) and by 188 km for an increase of 4 degrees C (minimum of 11 km, maximum of 393 km). Intra-specific turnovermeasuring the extent of change in global population genetic structurewas generally found to be moderate for 2 degrees C of temperature warming. For 4 degrees C of warming, however, the models indicated substantial intra-specific turnover for ten species. These results illustrate that, in spite of unavoidable simplifications, ancestry distribution models open new perspectives to forecast population genetic changes within species and complement more traditional distribution-based approaches.;"Alpine plants; ancestry distribution models; climate change; intra-specific variation; landscape genetics";"LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LANDSCAPE GENETICS; LOCAL ADAPTATION; MOUNTAIN PLANTS; ARABIS-ALPINA; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; MIGRATION RATES; CHANGE IMPACTS; EUROPEAN ALPS";"Biology & Biochemistry; Environment/Ecology; Molecular Biology & Genetics; Plant & Animal Science";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";"[Jay, Flora; Francois, Olivier] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, TIMC, IMAG,UMR 5525, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Manel, Stephanie] Aix Marseille Univ, Lab LPED Populat Environm Dev, IRD, UMR151, F-13331 Marseille 3, France; [Manel, Stephanie; Thuiller, Wilfried; Taberlet, Pierre] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine, UMR 5553, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Alvarez, Nadir] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Durand, Eric Y.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Holderegger, Rolf] WSL Swiss Fed Res Inst, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland";Francois, O (reprint author), Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, TIMC, IMAG,UMR 5525, F-38041 Grenoble, France.;"France; Switzerland; United States";"France; Switzerland; United States";"CHE; FRA; USA";29;MOLECULAR ECOLOGY;;;;;21;10;2354;2368;;10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05541.x;0962-1083;;;0962-1083;;oui;1;2012;oui;1;2012;"Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553; Techniques de l'Ingénierie Médicale et de la Complexité - Informatique, Mathématiques et Applications de Grenoble (TIMC-IMAG), UMR5525";"Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553; Techniques de l'Ingénierie Médicale et de la Complexité - Informatique, Mathématiques et Applications de Grenoble (TIMC-IMAG), UMR5525";"UMR5525; UMR5553";"UMR5525; UMR5553";5 - Exceptionelle

A peat bog record of atmospheric deposition shows considerable variation in dust deposition during the past 15 k.y., with abrupt changes in fl uxes at 12, 9.2, 8.4, 7.2, and 6 cal. kyr B.P. Using Nd isotopes and rare earth elements, it is possible to clearly distinguish between volcanic inputs and those driven by climate change, such as the long- term aridifi cation of the Sahara and regional erosion due to forest clearing and soil cultivation activities. Our results indicate that a major dust event in North Africa and Europe preceded the 8.2 kyr B. P. cold event by 200 yr. This dust event may have played an active role in the following climate cooling of the 8.2 kyr B.P. event. Nd isotope evidence also indicates a relatively slow change in dust regime over Europe from 7 to 5 kyr B.P. due to Sahara expansion.

Microevolutionary studies have shown that climate change may play a role in both population phylogeography and phenotypic differentiation. However, relatively little is known about the precise relationship between phylogeography and phenotypic variability and about how organisms respond to climate change. Location France, from sea level to the Alps (5 to > 2300 m a.s.l.). Methods This morphological analysis is based on first lower molar measurements from 16 geographically distinct common vole populations. Size and shape components are assessed separately. Population structure patterns are characterized using canonical variate analysis. We use phylogenetic analyses of two regions of mitochondrial DNA (the control region and the cytochrome b gene) to infer genetic structure. We calculate climate parameters from temperature and precipitation data. We investigate the influence of climate, geography and phylogeographical history on the phenotype using (1) multiple regression tests, (2) pairwise comparison of observation- by- variable matrices, and (3) a correlation method designed to compare three matrices. Results All populations were clearly structured, whatever the dataset. Neither size nor shape variation was correlated with climate parameters, but tooth shape was strongly correlated with both genetic structure and geographical distance. Main conclusions In French Microtus arvalis populations, molar shape differentiation is clearly associated with both phylogeographical history and geographical distance.

Because natural chemical weathering reactions occur at different and more complex chemical conditions than laboratory-based weathering experiments, it has long been thought that the underlying fluid-mineral interaction mechanisms are different. In contrast to most previous studies that have relied on ion, electron, and X-ray beam techniques (characterized by pm to mm lateral spatial resolution) to obtain chemical depth profiles of altered mineral surfaces, we have used high resolution and energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, EFTEM) to study mineral-fluid interfaces using TEM foils cut directly across the reaction boundaries. This allowed measurements to be made directly in cross section at nanometer to sub-nanometer-resolution. Our measurements of the surface chemistry and structure of a large suite of laboratory-altered and field-weathered silicate minerals indicate the general presence of surface layers composed of amorphous, hydrated silica. In each case, the boundary between the parent mineral and the corresponding silica layer is characterized by sharp, nanometer-scale chemical concentration jumps that are spatially coincident with a very sharp crystalline-amorphous interfacial boundary. TEM, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and aqueous chemistry data suggest that the surface layers are permeable to fluids. Taken together, our measurements are not in agreement with currently accepted models for chemical weathering, in particular the leached layer theory. Most importantly, our data provide critical evidence for a single mechanism based on interfacial dissolution-reprecipitation. This concept not only unifies weathering processes for the first time, but we also suggest that nanoscale-surface processes can have a potentially negative impact on CO2 uptake associated with chemical weathering. The results in this study, when combined with recently published research on fluid-assisted mineral replacement reactions, supports the idea that dissolution-reprecipitation is a universal mechanism controlling fluid-mineral interactions (Putnis and Putnis, 2007). Based on this we propose the existence of a chemical weathering continuum based solely on the interfacial dissolution-reprecipitation mechanism. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Global incidence has risen rapidly in recent decades with some 3.6 billion people, over half of the world's population, now at risk, mainly in urban centres of the tropics and subtropics. Demographic and societal changes, in particular urbanization, globalization, and increased international travel, are major contributors to the rise in incidence and geographic expansion of dengue infections. Major research gaps continue to hamper the control of dengue. The European Commission launched a call under the 7th Framework Programme with the title of 'Comprehensive control of Dengue fever under changing climatic conditions'. Fourteen partners from several countries in Europe, Asia, and South America formed a consortium named 'DengueTools' to respond to the call to achieve better diagnosis, surveillance, prevention, and predictive models and improve our understanding of the spread of dengue to previously uninfected regions (including Europe) in the context of globalization and climate change. The consortium comprises 12 work packages to address a set of research questions in three areas: Research area 1: Develop a comprehensive early warning and surveillance system that has predictive capability for epidemic dengue and benefits from novel tools for laboratory diagnosis and vector monitoring. Research area 2: Develop novel strategies to prevent dengue in children. Research area 3: Understand and predict the risk of global spread of dengue, in particular the risk of introduction and establishment in Europe, within the context of parameters of vectorial capacity, global mobility, and climate change. In this paper, we report on the rationale and specific study objectives of 'DengueTools'.

However, in mountain areas which are highly sensitive to erosion processes and where precipitation events can be localized, past evolution of hydrological activity might be more complicated. To assess these past hydrological changes, a paleolimnological approach was applied on a 13.4-m-long sediment core taken in alpine Lake Anterne (2063 m asl) and representing the last 3.5 ka. Lake sedimentation is mainly composed of flood deposits triggered by precipitation events. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses show that floods were more frequent during cold periods while high-intensity flood events occurred preferentially during warmer periods. In mild temperature conditions, both flood patterns are present. This underlines the complex relationship between flood hazards and climatic change in mountain areas. During the warmer and/or dryer times of the end of Iron Age and the Roman Period, both the frequency and intensity of floods increased. This is interpreted as an effect of human-induced clearing for grazing activities and reveals that anthropogenic interferences must be taken into account when reconstructing climatic signals from natural archives.

In the presence of a fragile environmental regulatory framework, inducement can indeed be endogenous and environmental innovations may be spurred by firms' reactions to their direct or related environmental performance. Cross-sector analysis focuses on a panel of Italian regions, over the time span 2003-2007, and is conducted by implementing zero-inflated regression models for count data variables. The empirical results suggest that in a context characterized by a weak regulatory framework, such as the Italian one, environmental performance has significant and complementary within- and between-sector effects on the generation of green technologies.

Lack of community responses to increased temperature, however, has also been reported for several taxa and regions, suggesting that climatic lags may be frequent. Here we show that microclimatic effects brought about by forest canopy closure can buffer biotic responses to macroclimate warming, thus explaining an apparent climatic lag. Using data from 1,409 vegetation plots in European and North American temperate forests, each surveyed at least twice over an interval of 12-67 y, we document significant thermophilization of ground-layer plant communities. These changes reflect concurrent declines in species adapted to cooler conditions and increases in species adapted to warmer conditions. However, thermophilization, particularly the increase of warm-adapted species, is attenuated in forests whose canopies have become denser, probably reflecting cooler growing-season ground temperatures via increased shading. As standing stocks of trees have increased in many temperate forests in recent decades, local microclimatic effects may commonly be moderating the impacts of macroclimate warming on forest understories. Conversely, increases in harvesting woody biomass-e.g., for bioenergy-may open forest canopies and accelerate thermophilization of temperate forest biodiversity.;"climate change; forest management; understory; climatic debt; range shifts";"RECENT CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOREST; VEGETATION; COMMUNITIES; ECOSYSTEM; SCALE; DEBT";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[De Frenne, Pieter; Baeten, Lander; Verstraeten, Gorik; Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Forest & Nat Lab, BE-9090 Gontrode Melle, Belgium; [Rodriguez-Sanchez, Francisco; Coomes, David Anthony] Univ Cambridge, Forest Ecol & Conservat Grp, Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Baeten, Lander] Univ Ghent, Terr Ecol Unit, Dept Biol, BE-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vellend, Mark; Brown, Carissa D.] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Bernhardt-Roemermann, Markus] Univ Regensburg, Inst Bot, DE-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Brown, Carissa D.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Geog, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada; [Brunet, Jorg] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Cornelis, Johnny] Agcy Nat & Forests, BE-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Decocq, Guillaume M.] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Edysan FRE 3498, FR-80037 Amiens, France; [Dierschke, Hartmut] Univ Gottingen, Dept Vegetat & Phytodivers Anal, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, DE-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Eriksson, Ove] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Gilliam, Frank S.] Marshall Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Huntington, WV 25701 USA; [Hedl, Radim] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Dept Vegetat Ecol, Inst Bot, CZ-65720 Brno, Czech Republic; [Heinken, Thilo] Univ Potsdam, Dept Biodivers Res Systemat Bot, Inst Biochem & Biol, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Hermy, Martin] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, BE-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Hommel, Patrick] Wageningen UR, Alterra Res Inst, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Jenkins, Michael A.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Kelly, Daniel L.; Mitchell, Fraser J.

In this paper, we projected the potential responses of bird communities to both climate and agricultural changes. We created four scenarios of agricultural changes (current trends, biofuel development, livestock extensification and agricultural extensification), each developed at national or regional level of policy-making. We further considered three climatic scenarios (A1B, A2 and B1) from among the IPCC 4th Assessment Report scenarios. We assessed changes in bird communities based on the predicted changes in agricultural land use and climatic suitability using various indicators, including the European Farmland Bird Indicator (FBI) and the Community Specialisation Index (CSI). We found that trends in the different indicators differed greatly from each other depending on the agricultural scenarios and policy-making scale. Our results suggest that public policies that promote extensive agricultural practices are more appropriate for improving the fate of bird communities in agricultural landscapes, especially with the regionalisation of agricultural policy. These results provide a readily accessible visualisation of the potential impacts of land use and climate change on farmland bird communities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasingly they are accepted as transitional environments and in Europe this term has been given legal and management importance; indeed, in some cases this has led to decisions with high economic repercussions. We have thus revisited the fundamental properties and paradigms of these systems in the light of recent ecological theory. The analysis has produced a unifying approach to transitional waters, by adopting and expanding the concept of ecotone to whole ecosystems, rather than ecosystem boundaries. Furthermore we have addressed the paradoxes related to (1) the gradients concerning variability and stability in the system, (2) the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as well as (3) the response and resilience of the system to anthropogenic stressors.

We calculate regional attributions of increased atmospheric CO2 using two different assumptions about land sinks. In the first approach, each absorber region is attributed 'domestic sinks' that occur within its boundaries. In the second, alternative approach, each emitter region is attributed 'foreign sinks' that it created indirectly through its contribution to increasing CO2. We unambiguously attribute the largest share of the historical increase in CO2 between pre-industrial times and the present-day period to developed countries. However, the excess CO2 in the atmosphere since pre-industrial times attributed to developing countries is greater than their share of cumulative CO2 emissions. This is because a greater fraction of their emissions occurred more recently. If emissions remain high over the coming decades, the share of excess CO2 attributable to developing countries will grow, and the sink service provided by forested regions-in particular those with tropical forest-to other regions will depend critically on future tropical land-use change.;;"CARBON-CYCLE; KYOTO-PROTOCOL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-USE; MODEL";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Ciais, P.; Gasser, T.; Paris, J.

Understanding the impact of temperature on performance traits is important as it may affect the ecology and fitness of ectothermic animals such as reptiles. Here, we examined the temperature dependence of performance in two species of South African dwarf chameleon (Bradypodion): one adapted to a semi-arid environment and one to a mesic environment. Ecologically relevant performance traits were tested at different temperatures to evaluate their thermal dependence, and temperature-performance breadths for 80% and 90% of each performance trait were calculated. Our results show distinct differences in the thermal dependence of speed-versus force-related performance traits. Moreover, our results show that the semi-arid species is better adapted to higher temperatures and as such has a better chance of coping with the predicted increases in environmental temperature. The mesic area-adapted species seems to be more sensitive to an increase in temperature and could therefore potentially be threatened by the predicted future climate change. However, further studies investigating the potential for acclimation in chameleons are needed to better understand how animals may respond to future climate change.;"behavior; temperature; reptile; climate change; adaptation";"LIZARD LACERTA-VIVIPARA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GRIPPING PERFORMANCE; LOCOMOTOR IMPAIRMENT; THERMAL PREFERENCES; MUSCLE TEMPERATURE; BITE PERFORMANCE; ESCAPE TACTICS; REPRODUCTION; BEHAVIOR";Biology & Biochemistry;Biology;"[Segall, Marion; Herrel, Anthony] MNHN, CNRS, UMR 7179, Dept Ecol & Gest Biodiversite, F-75231 Paris 5, France; [Tolley, Krystal A.] South African Natl Biodivers Inst, Appl Biodivers Res Div, ZA-7735 Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa; [Tolley, Krystal A.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Vanhooydonck, Bieke] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Measey, G.

O.";GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY Volume: 22 Issue: 10 Pages: 1106-1117 Published: 2013;English;Article;Aim Seed banks are central to the regeneration strategy of many plant species. Any factor altering seed bank density thus affects plant regeneration and population dynamics. Although seed banks are dynamic entities controlled by multiple environmental drivers, climatic factors are the most comprehensive, but still poorly understood. This study investigates how climatic variation structures seed production and resulting seed bank patterns. Location Temperate forests along a 1900km latitudinal gradient in north-western (NW) Europe. Methods Seed production and seed bank density were quantified in 153 plots along the gradient for four forest herbs with different seed longevity: Geum urbanum, Milium effusum, Poa nemoralis and Stachys sylvatica. We tested the importance of climatic and local environmental factors in shaping seed production and seed bank density. Results Seed production was determined by population size, and not by climatic factors. G.urbanum and M.effusum seed bank density declined with decreasing temperature (growing degree days) and/or increasing temperature range (maximum-minimum temperature). P.nemoralis and S.sylvatica seed bank density were limited by population size and not by climatic variables. Seed bank density was also influenced by other, local environmental factors such as soil pH or light availability. Different seed bank patterns emerged due to differential seed longevities. Species with long-lived seeds maintained constant seed bank densities by counteracting the reduced chance of regular years with high seed production at colder northern latitudes. Main conclusions Seed bank patterns show clear interspecific variation in response to climate across the distribution range. Not all seed banking species may be as well equipped to buffer climate change via their seed bank, notably in short-term persistent species. Since the buffering capacity of seed banks is key to species persistence, these results provide crucial information to advance climatic change predictions on range shifts, community and biodiversity responses.;"Climate change; interspecific variation; plant-climate interaction; seed longevity; seed production; temperate deciduous forest; temperature";"GEOGRAPHICAL-DISTRIBUTION; SOIL; PERSISTENCE; GERMINATION; RANGE; LONGEVITY; PLANTS; MASS; REPRODUCTION; TEMPERATURES";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Ecology; Geography, Physical";"[Plue, Jan; Cousins, Sara A.

However, whether and how species adapt to environmental changes remains unclear. By focusing on the realized niche (i.e. the actual space that a species inhabits and the resources it can access as a result of limiting biotic factors present in its habitat), we here examine shifts in the realized-niche width (i.e. ecological amplitude) and position (i.e. ecological optimum) of 26 common and widespread forest understorey plants across their distributional ranges. Location Temperate forests along a ca. 1800-km-long latitudinal gradient from northern France to central Sweden and Estonia. Methods We derived species' realized-niche width from a -diversity metric, which increases if the focal species co-occurs with more species. Based on the concept that species' scores in a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) represent the locations of their realized-niche positions, we developed a novel approach to run species-specific DCAs allowing the focal species to shift its realized-niche position along the studied latitudinal gradient while the realized-niche positions of other species were held constant. Results None of the 26 species maintained both their realized-niche width and position along the latitudinal gradient. Few species (9 of 26: 35%) shifted their realized-niche width, but all shifted their realized-niche position. With increasing latitude, most species (22 of 26: 85%) shifted their realized-niche position for soil nutrients and pH towards nutrient-poorer and more acidic soils. Main conclusions Forest understorey plants shifted their realized niche along the latitudinal gradient, suggesting local adaptation and/or plasticity. This macroecological pattern casts doubt on the idea that the realized niche is stable in space and time, which is a key assumption of species distribution models used to predict the future of biodiversity, hence raising concern about predicted extinction rates.;"Beta diversity; climate change; detrended correspondence analyses; Ellenberg indicator values; forest understorey plant species; niche optimum; niche width; plant community; realized niche";"CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; HABITAT GENERALISTS; LOCAL ADAPTATION; INDICATOR VALUES; BIODIVERSITY; SPECIALISTS; HYPOTHESIS; EVOLUTION; RESPONSES";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Ecology; Geography, Physical";"[Wasof, Safaa; Lenoir, Jonathan; Gallet-Moron, Emilie; Jamoneau, Aurelien; Decocq, Guillaume] Jules Verne Univ Picardy, UR Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises, EDYSAN, FRE CNRS 3498, F-80037 Amiens 1, France; [Brunet, Jorg] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Cousins, Sara A.

A major barrier is the spatial mismatch between the size of organisms and the scale at which climate data are collected and modeled. Using a meta-analysis of published literature, we show that grid lengths in species distribution models are, on average, ca. 10000-fold larger than the animals they study, and ca. 1000-fold larger than the plants they study. And the gap is even worse than these ratios indicate, as most work has focused on organisms that are significantly biased toward large size. This mismatch is problematic because organisms do not experience climate on coarse scales. Rather, they live in microclimates, which can be highly heterogeneous and strongly divergent from surrounding macroclimates. Bridging the spatial gap should be a high priority for research and will require gathering climate data at finer scales, developing better methods for downscaling environmental data to microclimates, and improving our statistical understanding of variation at finer scales. Interdisciplinary collaborations (including ecologists, engineers, climatologists, meteorologists, statisticians, and geographers) will be key to bridging the gap, and ultimately to providing scientifically grounded data and recommendations to conservation biologists and policy makers.;"body size; climate change; downscaling; fractals; grid size; maxent; refugia; spatial resolution; species distribution models; temperature";"SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; RECENT CLIMATE-CHANGE; BODY-TEMPERATURE; TERRESTRIAL ECTOTHERMS; OPERATIVE TEMPERATURES; FRACTAL ANALYSIS; FINE-SCALE; ENVIRONMENT; LANDSCAPES; RESPONSES";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Potter, Kristen A.; Woods, H.

We propose here an extended and original analysis of the temporal evolution of monthly rainfall, mean temperature (T-mean), maximum temperature (T-max) and minimum temperature (T-min) time series over two PABs (Huallaga and Ucayali) over the last 40years. This analysis is based on a new and more complete database that includes 77 weather stations over the 1965-2007 period, and we focus our attention on both annual and seasonal meteorological time series. A positive significant trend in mean temperature of 0.09 degrees C per decade is detected over the region with similar values in the Andes and rainforest when considering average data. However, a high percentage of stations with significant T-mean positive trends are located over the Andes region. Finally, changes in the mean values occurred earlier in T-max (during the 1970s) than in T-min (during the 1980s). In the PAB, there is neither trend nor mean change in rainfall during the 1965-2007 period. However, annual, summer and autumn rainfall in the southern Andes presents an important interannual variability that is associated with the sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic Ocean while there are limited relationships between rainfall and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. On the contrary, the interannual temperature variability is mainly related to ENSO events.

The United Nations organization has made efforts to control this situation, through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, where projects that seek to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) can be financially rewarded through Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) if they respect the requirements established by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), such as the use of methodologies approved by the CDM Executive Board (CDM-EB). Thus, a methodology was developed according to the CDM standards related to the aeration, excavation and composting of closed Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) landfills, which was submitted to CDM-EB for assessment and, after its approval, applied to a real case study in Maringa City (Brazil) with a view to avoiding negative environmental impacts due the production of methane and leachates even after its closure. This paper describes the establishment of this CDM-EB-approved methodology to determine baseline emissions, project emissions and the resultant emission reductions with the application of appropriate aeration, excavation and composting practices at closed MSW landfills. A further result obtained through the application of the methodology in the landfill case study was that it would be possible to achieve an ex-ante emission reduction of 74,013 tCO(2) equivalent if the proposed CDM project activity were implemented.;"greenhouse gases; clean development mechanism; municipal solid wastes; composting; UNFCCC";"GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; WASTE MANAGEMENT; MUNICIPAL WASTE; ENERGY; PROJECTS";Environment/Ecology;Environmental Sciences;"[Janke, Leandro; Lima, Andre O.

The general aim of this study was to evaluate EQ as a predictive tool of the xeric limit of the beech at the southern edge of its distribution and to predict future changes in the xeric limit. The novelty of this study is its assessment of EQ accuracy for Serbia, the beech populations of which were separated from Central European refugia during the last glacial period. Climate projections from the coupled regional climate model EBU-POM were used to predict the changes in the xeric limit in the 21st century. The computation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves showed that EQ had good and fair predictive ability for two samples. Using three threshold criteria and different samples, the beech xeric limit in Serbia for the reference period of 1961-1990 varied between EQ values of 20.1 and 29.5. Significant changes in the beech xeric limits were predicted for the 21st century. The EQ calculations for 2001-2030 (A1B scenario) predicted that more than 20% of the present-day beech forests will be located outside of the ideal bioclimatic niche characterised by EQ <= 30 that was proposed by Ellenberg. For 2071-2100 (A1B and A2 scenarios), up to 90% of the current beech forests are expected to be located outside of that niche, and approximately 50% will be located beyond the limit EQ=40 for which beech mass mortalities have been observed. The results suggest an urgent need for the development of adaptive forest management strategies for beech in this region. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A rapid adaptive response of animals to such change could be due to reversible phenotypic flexibility, including behavioral flexibility. Our model, the African striped mouse Rhabdomys, is a small rodent widely distributed in southern Africa. The desert-living species R. pumilio displays social flexibility, whereby individuals switch their social organization in response to prevailing conditions, potentially allowing for persistence in rapidly changing environments. Individuals of the species from the moist grasslands (R. dilectus) show some flexible traits, but opportunities to utilize this potential are apparently not realized. The climate in southern Africa is predicted to become drier, making both desert and grassland species vulnerable to environmental change. Based on realized or potential social flexibility in striped mice, we provide three (not mutually exclusive) scenarios that consider: (i) extinction of the desert species as its habitat changes; (ii) range expansion and utilization of pre-existing adaptations of the desert species to displace the current grassland species; and (iii) grassland species exploiting their potential flexibility (behavioral adaptation) and surviving in their current habitat. Behavioral flexibility is costly but could allow species to persist in rapidly changing environments.";"adaptation; anthropogenic impact; behavioral flexibility; climate change; intra-specific variation in social organization; phenotypic flexibility; phenotypic plasticity; Rhabdomys; social flexibility";"MALE REPRODUCTIVE TACTICS; LIVING SOLITARY FORAGER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; DEVELOPMENTAL PLASTICITY; SUCCULENT KAROO; SOUTH-AFRICA; ECOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS; SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION; PUMILIO SPARRMAN";"Environment/Ecology; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"[Rymer, Tasmin L.; Pillay, Neville; Schradin, Carsten] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Rymer, Tasmin L.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Schradin, Carsten] Univ Strasbourg, IPHC DEPE, F-67087 Strasbourg, France; [Schradin, Carsten] CNRS, UMR7178, F-67087 Strasbourg, France";Rymer, TL (reprint author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.;"Australia; France; South Africa";"Australia; France; South Africa";"AUS; FRA; ZAF";1;SUSTAINABILITY;;;;;5;1;163;186;;10.3390/su5010163;2071-1050;;;2071-1050;;oui;1;2013;oui;1;2013;Institut pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien (IPHC), UMR7178;Institut pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien (IPHC), UMR7178;UMR7178;UMR7178;2 - Acceptable

Environmental changes were reconstructed using multiproxy analysis (pollen-based vegetation and climate reconstruction, lake levels, magnetic susceptibility and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements) recorded climate and land-use changes during the Lateglacial and early-middle Holocene. The well-dated and high-resolution pollen record of Lake Ledro is compared with vegetation records from the southern and northern Alps to trace the history of tree species distribution. An altitudedependent progressive time delay of the first continuous occurrence of Abies (fir) and of the Larix (larch) development has been observed since the Lateglacial in the southern Alps. This pattern suggests that the mid-altitude Lake Ledro area was not a refuge and that trees originated from lowlands or hilly areas (e.g. Euganean Hills) in northern Italy. Preboreal oscillations (ca. 11 000 cal BP), Boreal oscillations (ca. 10 200, 9300 cal BP) and the 8.2 kyr cold event suggest a centennial-scale climate forcing in the studied area. Picea (spruce) expansion occurred preferentially around 10 200 and 8200 cal BP in the south-eastern Alps, and therefore reflects the long-lasting cumulative effects of successive boreal and the 8.2 kyr cold event. The extension of Abies is contemporaneous with the 8.2 kyr event, but its development in the southern Alps benefits from the wettest interval 8200-7300 cal BP evidenced in high lake levels, flood activity and pollen-based climate reconstructions. Since ca. 7500 cal BP, a weak signal of pollen-based anthropogenic activities suggest weak human impact. The period between ca. 5700 and ca. 4100 cal BP is considered as a transition period to colder and wetter conditions (particularly during summers) that favoured a dense beech (Fagus) forest development which in return caused a distinctive yew (Taxus) decline.We conclude that climate was the dominant factor controlling vegetation changes and erosion processes during the early and middle Holocene (up to ca. 4100 cal BP).;;"SWISS ALPS; CONTRASTING PATTERNS; LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS; HUMAN IMPACT; POLLEN DATA; POPULATION EXPANSION; MEDITERRANEAN REGION; SEASONALITY CHANGES; FAGUS-SYLVATICA; CENTRAL-EUROPE";Geosciences;"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Joannin, S.; Magny, M.] CNRS, USR3124, MSHE Ledoux, Besancon, France; [Joannin, S.; Vanniere, B.; Peyron, O.; Magny, M.] Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR6249, Lab Chrono Environm, Besancon, France; [Joannin, S.] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5276, LGL TPE, Villeurbanne, France; [Joannin, S.] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Galop, D.] Maison Rech Univ Mirail, CNRS, UMR5602, GEODE, Toulouse, France; [Haas, J.

The models as a class represent the observation-based distribution of oxygen (O-2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), albeit major mismatches between observation-based and simulated values remain for individual models. By year 2100 all models project an increase in SST between 2 degrees C and 3 degrees C, and a decrease in the pH and in the saturation state of water with respect to calcium carbonate minerals in the UML. A decrease in the total ocean inventory of dissolved oxygen by 2% to 4% is projected by the range of models. Projected O-2 changes in the UML show a complex pattern with both increasing and decreasing trends reflecting the subtle balance of different competing factors such as circulation, production, remineralization, and temperature changes. Projected changes in the total volume of hypoxic and suboxic waters remain relatively small in all models. A widespread increase of CO2 in the UML is projected.

We analyzed trends in dates of onset and termination of snow cover in relation to temperature over the past 27 years (1980-2006) from over 636 meteorological stations in the Northern Hemisphere. Different trends in snow duration are observed over North America and Eurasia. Over North America, the termination date of snow cover remained stable during the 27 years, whereas over Eurasia it has advanced by 2.6 +/- 5.6 d decade(-1). Earlier snow cover termination is systematically correlated on a year-to-year basis with a positive temperature anomaly during the snowmelt month with a sensitivity of -0.077 degrees C d(-1). These snow feedbacks to air temperature are more important in spring, because high net radiation is coupled with thin snow cover.;"climate change; climate feedback; global warming; snow phenology";"CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALBEDO FEEDBACK; VEGETATION INDEX; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; COVER; SYSTEM; ECOSYSTEMS; IMPACT; FUTURE";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Peng, Shushi; Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Ciais, Philippe; Wang, Tao] CEA, LCSE, UVSQ, CNRS,UMR, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Friedlingstein, Pierre] Univ Bristol, QUEST, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; [Zhou, Liming] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA";Piao, SL (reprint author), Peking Univ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;"France; People's Republic of China; United Kingdom; United States";"France; People's Republic of China; United Kingdom; United States";"CHN; FRA; GBR; USA";11;ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS;;;;;8;1;;;014008;10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/014008;1748-9326;;;1748-9326;;oui;1;2013;oui;1;2013;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;UMR8212;UMR8212;4 - Excellente

In this paper, we present a new marine pollen sequence (core MD04-2797CQ) from the Siculo-Tunisian Strait documenting the regional vegetation and climatic changes in the southern Central Mediterranean during the last deglaciation and the Holocene. The MD04-2797CQ marine pollen sequence shows that semi-desert plants dominated the vegetal cover in the southern Central Mediterranean between 18.2 and 12.3 ka cal BP, indicating prevailing dry conditions during the deglaciation, even during the Greenland Interstadial (GI)-1. Across the transition Greenland Stadial (GS)-1 -Holocene, Asteraceae-Poaceae steppe became dominant till 10.1 ka cal BP. This record underlines with no chronological ambiguity that even though temperatures increased, deficiency in moisture availability persisted into the early Holocene. Temperate trees and shrubs with heath underbrush or maquis expanded between 10.1 and 6.6 ka, corresponding to Sapropel 1 (S1) interval, while Mediterranean plants only developed from 6.6 ka onwards. These changes in vegetal cover show that the regional climate in southern Central Mediterranean was wetter during S1 and became drier during the mid-to late Holocene. Wetter conditions during S1 were likely due to increased winter precipitation while summers remained dry. We suggest, in agreement with published modeling experiments, that the early Holocene increased melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet in conjunction with weak winter insolation played a major role in the development of winter precipitation maxima in the Mediterranean region in controlling the strength and position of the North Atlantic storm track. Finally, our data provide evidence for centennial-scale vegetation and climatic changes in the southern Central Mediterranean. During the wet early Holocene, alkenone-derived cooling episodes are synchronous with herbaceous composition changes that indicate muted changes in precipitation. In contrast, enhanced aridity episodes, as detected by strong reduction in trees and shrubs, are recorded during the mid-to late Holocene. We show that the impact of the Holocene cooling events on the Mediterranean hydroclimate depend on baseline climate states, i.e. insolation and ice sheet extent, shaping the response of the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation.;;"LAKE-LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS; FRESH-WATER OUTBURSTS; LAGO-DI-PERGUSA; LAURENTIDE ICE-SHEET; LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM; NORTH-ATLANTIC; HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES; POLLEN DATA; MIDHOLOCENE VEGETATION; CONTRASTING PATTERNS";Geosciences;"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Desprat, S.] Univ Bordeaux 1, CNRS, UMR 5805, EPHE, F-33405 Talence, France; [Combourieu-Nebout, N.; Sicre, M.

While the effects of these stressors on marine organisms have been relatively well explored in isolation, possible interactions between temperature and OA have yet to be thoroughly investigated. OA at levels projected to occur within this century has few direct ecological effects on the early life history stages of corals. In contrast, temperature has pronounced effects on many stages in the early life history of corals. Here, we test whether temperature might act in combination with OA to produce a measurable ecological effect on fertilization, development, larval survivorship or metamorphosis of 2 broadcast spawning species, Acropora millepora and A. tenuis, from the Great Barrier Reef. We used 4 treatments: control, high temperature (+2 degrees C), high partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) (700 mu atm) and a combination of high temperature and high pCO(2), corresponding to the current levels of these variables and the projected values for the end of this century under the IPCC A2 scenario. We found no consistent effect of elevated pCO(2) on fertilization, development, survivorship or metamorphosis, neither alone nor in combination with temperature. In contrast, a 2 degrees C rise in temperature increased rates of development, but otherwise had no consistent effect on fertilization, survivorship or metamorphosis. We conclude that OA is unlikely to be a direct threat to the early life history stages of corals, at least in the near future. In contrast, rising sea temperatures are likely to affect coral population dynamics by increasing the rate of larval development with resulting changes in patterns of connectivity.;"Coral reefs; Climate change; Connectivity; Development; Larval ecology; Survivorship; Settlement";"SCLERACTINIAN CORAL; DIPLORIA-STRIGOSA; ACROPORA-PALMATA; CARBONIC-ACID; FERTILIZATION; EMBRYOGENESIS; SETTLEMENT; RECRUITS; LARVAE; CALCIFICATION";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Plant & Animal Science";"Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography";"[Chua, Chia Miin; Leggat, William; Moya, Aurelie; Baird, Andrew H.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Leggat, William] James Cook Univ, Sch Pharm & Mol Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Moya, Aurelie] INSU CNRS, Lab Oceanog Villefranche, F-06234 Villefranche Sur Mer, France; [Moya, Aurelie] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Observ Oceanol Villefranche, F-06230 Villefranche Sur Mer, France";Chua, CM (reprint author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;"Australia; France";"Australia; France";"AUS; FRA";17;MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES;;;;;475;;85;92;;10.3354/meps10077;0171-8630;1616-1599;;0171-8630 eISSN: 1616-1599;;oui;1;2013;oui;1;2013;"Laboratoire d'océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), UMR7093; Observatoire océanologique de Villefranche-sur-mer, UMS829";"Laboratoire d'océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), UMR7093; Observatoire océanologique de Villefranche-sur-mer, UMS829";"UMR7093; UMS829";"UMR7093; UMS829";4 - Excellente

Tuna are of particular importance in the tropical Pacific, as they contribute significantly to the livelihoods, food and economic security of island states. Changes in water properties and circulation will impact on tuna larval dispersal, preferred habitat distributions and the trophic systems that support tuna populations throughout the region. Using recent observations and ocean projections from the CMIP3 and preliminary results from CMIP5 climate models, we document the projected changes to ocean temperature, salinity, stratification and circulation most relevant to distributions of tuna. Under a business-as-usual emission scenario, projections indicate a surface intensified warming in the upper 400 m and a large expansion of the western Pacific Warm Pool, with most surface waters of the central and western equatorial Pacific reaching temperatures warmer than 29 degrees C by 2100. These changes are likely to alter the preferred habitat of tuna, based on present-day thermal tolerances, and in turn the distribution of spawning and foraging grounds. Large-scale shoaling of the mixed layer and increases in stratification are expected to impact nutrient provision to the biologically active layer, with flow-on trophic effects on the micronekton.

Some products of mineral dissolution would precipitate in soils or be taken up by ecosystems, but a significant portion would be transported to the coastal zone and the open ocean, where the increase in alkalinity would partially counteract ocean acidification associated with the current marked increase in atmospheric CO2. Other elements released during this mineral dissolution, like Si, P, or K, could stimulate biological productivity, further helping to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. On land, the terrestrial carbon pool would likely increase in response to Enhanced Weathering in areas where ecosystem growth rates are currently limited by one of the nutrients that would be released during mineral dissolution. In the ocean, the biological carbon pumps (which export organic matter and CaCO3 to the deep ocean) may be altered by the resulting influx of nutrients and alkalinity to the ocean.

The environmental impact of using biomass depends mostly on the transportation process. Authors define the notion of maximum supply distance, beyond which biomass transportation becomes too environmentally intensive compared to a fossil fuel fired heating system. In this work a carbon footprint analysis and an emergy evaluation, has been chosen to study the substitution of wood for natural gas. The comparative study seeks to examine, via the two approaches, two heating systems: one is fired with wood, transported by trucks and the other one is fired with natural gas transported by pipelines. The results are expressed in terms of maximum supply distance of wood. In the emergy evaluation it represents the maximum supply distance permitting wood to be more emergy saving than natural gas. In the carbon footprint analysis, it represents the maximum supply distance permitting wood to be a carbon saving alternative to natural gas. Furthermore, the unification of carbon footprint and emergy evaluation permits to define, for both approaches, the minimum theoretical wood burner first law efficiency that allows, CO2 or emergy to be saved, when there is no wood transport. In order to identify the impacts of the main parameters of the study a sensitivity analysis has been carried out. The case study investigated in this paper shows that there is a large gap between the results. The maximum supply distances calculated via carbon footprint and emergy evaluation are about 5000 km and 1000 km, respectively, anthe minimum theoretical wood burner efficiencies are about 5% and 54%, respectively.

Roe deer are income breeders, with high levels of allocation to reproduction, and are hence strongly constrained by the availability of high quality resources during spring. We investigated how recent climate change has influenced demographic processes in two populations of this widespread species. Spring began increasingly earlier over the study, allowing us to identify 2 periods with contrasting onset of spring. Both populations grew more slowly when spring was early. As expected for a long-lived and iteroparous species, adult survival had the greatest potential impact on population growth. Using perturbation analyses, we measured the relative contribution of the demographic parameters to observed variation in population growth, both within and between periods and populations. Within periods, the identity of the critical parameter depended on the variance in growth rate, but variation in recruitment was the main driver of observed demographic change between periods of contrasting spring earliness. Our results indicate that roe deer in forest habitats cannot currently cope with increasingly early springs.

Here, we review the use of latitudinal gradients for ecological climate change research, in comparison with altitudinal gradients and experimental warming, and illustrate their use and caveats with a meta-analysis of latitudinal intraspecific variation in important life-history traits of vascular plants. We first provide an overview of latitudinal patterns in temperature and other abiotic and biotic environmental variables in terrestrial ecosystems. We then assess the latitudinal intraspecific variation present in five key life-history traits [plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), foliar nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) stoichiometry, seed mass and root:shoot (R:S) ratio] in natural populations or common garden experiments across a total of 98 plant species. Intraspecific leaf N:P ratio and seed mass significantly decreased with latitude in natural populations. Conversely, the plant height decreased and SLA increased significantly with latitude of population origin in common garden experiments. However, less than a third of the investigated latitudinal transect studies also formally disentangled the effects of temperature from other environmental drivers which potentially hampers the translation from latitudinal effects into a temperature signal. Synthesis. Latitudinal gradients provide a methodological set-up to overcome the drawbacks of other observational and experimental warming methods. Our synthesis indicates that many life-history traits of plants vary with latitude but the translation of latitudinal clines into responses to temperature is a crucial step. Therefore, especially adaptive differentiation of populations and confounding environmental factors other than temperature need to be considered. More generally, integrated approaches of observational studies along temperature gradients, experimental methods and common garden experiments increasingly emerge as the way forward to further our understanding of species and community responses to climate warming.;"altitudinal gradients; climate change; common garden experiments; experimental warming; functional life-history traits; global warming; latitude; plantclimate interactions; transplant experiments";"RAPID CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOLOGY STRATEGY SCHEME; HERB ANEMONE-NEMOROSA; GLOBAL PATTERNS; FOREST HERBS; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; SEED-SIZE; LEAF TEMPERATURES; LOCAL ADAPTATION; PLANT-RESISTANCE";"Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Plant Sciences; Ecology";"[De Frenne, Pieter; De Schrijver, An; Gruwez, Robert; Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Forest & Nat Lab, BE-9090 Gontrode Melle, Belgium; [De Frenne, Pieter; Rodriguez-Sanchez, Francisco; Coomes, David A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Forest Ecol & Conservat Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Graae, Bente J.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Kolb, Annette; Diekmann, Martin] Univ Bremen, FB2, Inst Ecol, DE-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Chabrerie, Olivier; Decocq, Guillaume; Lenoir, Jonathan] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, EDYSAN, FRE CNRS 3498, FR-80037 Amiens, France; [De Kort, Hanne] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, BE-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Eriksson, Ove] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hermy, Martin] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, BE-3001 Louvain, Belgium; [Plue, Jan] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Quaternary Geol, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden";De Frenne, P (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Forest & Nat Lab, Geraardsbergsesteenweg 267, BE-9090 Gontrode Melle, Belgium.;"Belgium; France; Germany; Norway; Sweden; United Kingdom";"Belgium; France; Germany; Norway; Sweden; United Kingdom";"BEL; DEU; FRA; GBR; NOR; SWE";34;JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY;;;;;101;3;784;795;;10.1111/1365-2745.12074;0022-0477;;;0022-0477;;oui;1;2013;oui;1;2013;Ecologie et dynamique des systèmes anthropisés (EDYSAN), FRE3498;Ecologie et dynamique des systèmes anthropisés (EDYSAN), FRE3498;FRE3498;FRE3498;5 - Exceptionelle

Based on an unusually dense data set of 3036 tree-ring series extracted from 759 conifers, we provide evidence for 61 landslide reactivations since A.D. 1898. Based on logistic regressions and threshold analyses of monthly rainfall data and temperature anomalies, we determine that the combination of snow-rich winters and positive temperature anomalies in spring (enhanced snowmelt) seems to have driven landslide reactivations in the past. Since the early 1990s, however, landslide reactivations clearly have been on the rise and thereby exhibit excessive and unprecedented rates of activity (12.5 events per 10 yr) at the scale of the Riou Bourdoux catchment. From the data, evidence exists for a shift from snowmelt-induced landslides (controlled by winter precipitation) to reactivations controlled by spring temperatures. Therefore, this contribution also adds evidence to the hypothesis that climate change (and related warmer springs) could further enhance landslide activity in the course of the 21st century.;;"REACTIVATION; FRANCE; FLOOD; MAPS";Geosciences;Geology;"[Saez, Jerome Lopez; Berger, Frederic] UR EMGR, Inst Natl Rech Sci & Technol Environm & Agr, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Corona, Christophe; Stoffel, Markus] Univ Bern, Inst Geol Sci, Lab Dendrogeomorphol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Corona, Christophe] Univ Clermont Ferrand, Photochim Mol & Macromol Lab, CNRS, UMR6042,Geolab, F-63177 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Stoffel, Markus] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, CH-1227 Carouge, Switzerland";Saez, JL (reprint author), UR EMGR, Inst Natl Rech Sci & Technol Environm & Agr, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France.;"France; Switzerland";"France; Switzerland";"CHE; FRA";8;GEOLOGY;;;;;41;5;619;622;;10.1130/G34098.1;0091-7613;;;0091-7613;;oui;1;2013;oui;1;2013;Institut de Chimie de Clermont-Ferrand (ICCF), UMR6296;Institut de Chimie de Clermont-Ferrand (ICCF), UMR6296;UMR6296;UMR6296;5 - Exceptionelle

We used factor analysis to obtain three main benthic assemblages related to eutrophic, mesotrophic, and oxygenated environments; planktic foraminifers were grouped as warm-water and cold-turbulent species. These results were compared with records of CaCO3 and major and trace elements (Al, Ca, K, Sr) as well as the C/N ratio of organic matter. Power and cross-spectral analysis showed a straightforward relationship between precession minima and thermal stratification of the water column as well as the occurrence of eutrophic bottom conditions during lowstand periods and mesotrophic environments at times of highstand. These eutrophic-mesotrophic oscillations, usually driven by global eustatic change, also involved regional variations in CaCO3 source to this environment. During periods of precession maxima, enhancement of northwesterly winds increased primary productivity by mixing, enhancing the percentage of cold-turbulent species in the water column and the proportion of oxygenated benthic species on the bottom. During interglacial stages, these events were recorded by lower biogenic carbonate at the expense of higher silicate-related components most likely due to a higher supply from Pyrenees rivers. The record of oxygenated benthic species can be a good proxy to monitor past changes in Winter Intermediate Water dynamics driven by northwesterly winds.";"foraminifer; sea level; northwesterly winds; Gulf of Lions";"EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEA; DEEP-WATER; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; SUBMARINE CANYONS; ORGANIC-CARBON; RECORD; VARIABILITY; CIRCULATION; HYDRODYNAMICS; DEPOSITION";Geosciences;Geochemistry & Geophysics;"[Cortina, Aleix; Javier Sierro, Francisco; Abel Flores, Jose] Univ Salamanca, Dept Geol, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain; [Filippelli, Gabriel] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Berne, Serge] Univ Perpignan, CEFREM, F-66860 Perpignan, France";Cortina, A (reprint author), Univ Salamanca, Dept Geol, Plaza Merced Sn, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain.;"France; Spain; United States";"France; Spain; United States";"ESP; FRA; USA";0;GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS;;;;;14;4;1258;1276;;10.1002/ggge.20096;1525-2027;;;1525-2027;;oui;1;2013;oui;1;2013;Centre de formation et de recherche sur les environnements méditerranéens (CEFREM), UMR5110;Centre de formation et de recherche sur les environnements méditerranéens (CEFREM), UMR5110;UMR5110;UMR5110;4 - Excellente

Near-term climate prediction is a new information tool for the climate adaptation and service communities, which often make decisions on near-term time scales, and for which the most basic information is unfortunately very scarce. The Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project set of co-ordinated climate-model experiments includes a set of near-term predictions in which several modelling groups participated and whose forecast quality we illustrate here. We show that climate forecast systems have skill in predicting the Earth's temperature at regional scales over the past 50 years and illustrate the trustworthiness of their predictions. Most of the skill can be attributed to changes in atmospheric composition, but also partly to the initialization of the predictions.;;"DECADAL PREDICTION; VARIABILITY; MODEL; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATION; PREDICTABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; SENSITIVITY; ENSEMBLES; FORECASTS";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Doblas-Reyes, F.

Serpentinites play essential roles in numerous geological settings. They act as a lubricant along plate boundaries during aseismic creep and contribute to the geochemical cycle of subduction zones. In the mantle, they are a reservoir of water and fluid-mobile elements. Serpentinites can produce nickel ore where weathered, and they can sequester CO2 where carbonated. They may have provided an environment for the abiotic generation of amino acids on the early Earth and other planets, potentially leading to the development of life.;"serpentinization; geochemical cycle; arc magma; seismicity; nickel ore; CO2 sequestration; origin of life";FORE-ARC;Geosciences;"Geochemistry & Geophysics; Mineralogy";"[Guillot, Stephane] Univ Grenoble, CNRS, ISTerre, Grenoble 9, France; [Hattori, Keiko] Univ Ottawa, Dept Earth Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada";Guillot, S (reprint author), Univ Grenoble, CNRS, ISTerre, 1381 Rue Piscine, Grenoble 9, France.;"Canada; France";"Canada; France";"CAN; FRA";12;ELEMENTS;;;;;9;2;95;98;;10.2113/gselements.9.2.95;1811-5209;;;1811-5209;;oui;1;2013;oui;1;2013;Institut des Sciences de la Terre (ISTerre), UMR5275;Institut des Sciences de la Terre (ISTerre), UMR5275;UMR5275;UMR5275;5 - Exceptionelle

S.; Li, L.; Le Treut, H.";CLIMATE DYNAMICS Volume: 40 Issue: 7-8 Pages: 1569-1589 Published: 2013;English;Article;Recent studies have shown that global warming and associated sea-surface temperature (SST) changes may trigger an important rainfall increase in southeastern South America (SESA) during the austral summer (December-January-February, DJF). The goal of this paper is to provide some insight into processes which may link global and SESA changes. For this purpose, a two-way nesting system coupling interactively the regional and global versions of the LMDZ4 atmospheric model is used to study the response to prescribed SST changes. The regional model is a variable-grid version of the global model, with a zoom focused over South America. An ensemble of simulations forced by distinct patterns of DJF SST changes has been carried out using a decomposition of full SST changes into their longitudinal and latitudinal components. The full SST changes are based on projections for the end of the twenty-first century from a multi-model ensemble of WCRP/CMIP3. Results confirm the presence of a major rainfall dipole structure, characterized by an increase in SESA and a decrease in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone region. Rainfall changes found in the WCRP/CMIP3 models are largely explained as a response of this dipole structure to the zonally-asymmetric (or longitudinal) component of SST changes. The rainfall response to the zonal-mean (or latitudinal) SST changes (including the global warming signal itself) shows an opposite contribution. The processes explaining the role of zonally-asymmetric SST changes involve remote effects of SST warming over the equatorial Indian and Pacific oceans inducing an atmospheric wave-train extended across the South Pacific into South America.;"South America climate; Rainfall changes; Two-way nesting system; Sea surface temperature projections; Climate change";"SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES; LOW-LEVEL CIRCULATION; EL-NINO; TROPOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; TROPICAL PRECIPITATION; ATMOSPHERIC MODEL; CLIMATE; MONSOON; ANDES";Geosciences;Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences;"[Junquas, C.; Li, L.; Le Treut, H.] UPMC, CNRS, Lab Meteorol Dynam, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Paris, France; [Junquas, C.; Vera, C.

Japan is a recently derived fragment island with a rich endemic flora and fauna. These endemic species have been described as paleoendemics, and conversely as recently derived Pleistocene colonists. Geological events in the Miocene period, notably the fragmentation and collision of islands, and the subsequent uplift of mountains in central Japan, provided opportunities for genetic isolation. More recently, cyclical climatic change during the Pliocene and Pleistocene periods led to intermittent land bridge connections to continental Asia. Here we investigate the pattern and timing of diversification in a diverse endemic lineage in order to test whether ongoing migration has sustained species diversity, whether there is evidence of relaxation, and how geological and climatic events are associated with lineage diversification. Using multi-locus genetic data, we test these hypotheses in a poorly dispersing, cold-adapted terrestrial insect lineage (Grylloblattodea: Grylloblattidae) sampled from Japan, Korea, and Russia. In phylogenetic analyses of concatenated data and a species tree approach, we find evidence of three deeply divergent lineages of rock-crawlers in Japan consistent with the pattern of island fragmentation from continental Asia. Tests of lineage diversification rates suggest that relaxation has not occurred and instead endemism has increased in the Japanese Grylloblattidae following mountain-building events in the Miocene. Although the importance of climate change in generating species diversity is a commonly held paradigm in Japanese biogeography, our analyses, including analyses of demographic change and phylogeographic range shifts in putative species, suggests that Pleistocene climatic change has had a limited effect on the diversification of rock-crawlers.

Warming can alter above- and belowground linkages that regulate soil organic carbon dynamics and C-balance in peatlands. Here we examine the multiyear impact of in situ experimental warming on the microbial food web, vegetation, and their feedbacks with soil chemistry. We provide evidence of both positive and negative impacts of warming on specific microbial functional groups, leading to destabilization of the microbial food web. We observed a strong reduction (70%) in the biomass of top-predators (testate amoebae) in warmed plots. Such a loss caused a shortening of microbial food chains, which in turn stimulated microbial activity, leading to slight increases in levels of nutrients and labile C in water. We further show that warming altered the regulatory role of Sphagnum-polyphenols on microbial community structure with a potential inhibition of top predators. In addition, warming caused a decrease in Sphagnum cover and an increase in vascular plant cover. Using structural equation modelling, we show that changes in the microbial food web affected the relationships between plants, soil water chemistry, and microbial communities. These results suggest that warming will destabilize C and nutrient recycling of peatlands via changes in above- and belowground linkages, and therefore, the microbial food web associated with mosses will feedback positively to global warming by destabilizing the carbon cycle. This study confirms that microbial food webs thus constitute a key element in the functioning of peatland ecosystems. Their study can help understand how mosses, as ecosystem engineers, tightly regulate biogeochemical cycling and climate feedback in peatlands;"food chains; microbial food web; plant and microbial communities; polyphenols; testate amoebae; water chemistry";"TESTATE AMEBAS PROTOZOA; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; DOMINATED PEATLANDS; SOIL BIODIVERSITY; WATER CHEMISTRY; LITTER QUALITY; SIZE STRUCTURE; NEBELA-TINCTA; GLOBAL CHANGE; ELEVATED CO2";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Jassey, Vincent E.

Over the past several decades, several studies focused on shifts in spring phenology; however, large uncertainties still exist, and one understudied source could be the method implemented in retrieving satellite-derived spring phenology. To account for this potential uncertainty, we conducted a multimethod investigation to quantify changes in vegetation green-up date from 1982 to 2010 over temperate China, and to characterize climatic controls on spring phenology. Over temperate China, the five methods estimated that the vegetation green-up onset date advanced, on average, at a rate of 1.3 similar to +/-similar to 0.6 similar to days per decade (ranging from 0.4 to 1.9 similar to days per decade) over the last 29 similar to years. Moreover, the sign of the trends in vegetation green-up date derived from the five methods were broadly consistent spatially and for different vegetation types, but with large differences in the magnitude of the trend. The large intermethod variance was notably observed in arid and semiarid vegetation types. Our results also showed that change in vegetation green-up date is more closely correlated with temperature than with precipitation. However, the temperature sensitivity of spring vegetation green-up date became higher as precipitation increased, implying that precipitation is an important regulator of the response of vegetation spring phenology to change in temperature. This intricate linkage between spring phenology and precipitation must be taken into account in current phenological models which are mostly driven by temperature.";"china; climate change; phenology; spring vegetation green-up date; temperature sensitivity of spring phenology";"TIME-SERIES; GROWING-SEASON; NDVI DATA; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CHANGE IMPACTS; NORTH-AMERICA; PHENOLOGY; WATER; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Cong, Nan; Nan, Huijuan; Ma, Yuecun; Wang, Xuhui; Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sinofrench Inst Earth Syst Sci, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc,Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tao] CEA CNRS UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China";Piao, SL (reprint author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sinofrench Inst Earth Syst Sci, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc,Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;"France; People's Republic of China; United States";"France; People's Republic of China; United States";"CHN; FRA; USA";29;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;19;3;881;891;;10.1111/gcb.12077;1354-1013;;;1354-1013;;oui;1;2013;oui;1;2013;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;UMR8212;UMR8212;5 - Exceptionelle

Experiments were performed in aqueous solutions 1) supersaturated with respect to calcite for up to 63 days, and 2) strongly undersaturated with respect to calcite and other secondary phases for up to 164 days. Inlet solutions were comprised of NaHCO3, CaCl2, NH4Cl, NaOH, and/or HCl with ionic strengths ranging from 0.01 to 0.09 mol/kg. In the experiments performed at 25 degrees C, calcite nucleated and grew extensively on both the diopside surfaces, and as <1000 mu m discrete crystals in experiments performed in CO3-bearing inlet solutions but no precipitates were formed on or adjacent to the diopside in experiments performed in CO3-free inlet solutions. Measured diopside dissolution rates in calcite precipitating experiments at 25 degrees C based on Si are both 1) time independent, and 2) equal to that of corresponding control experiments performed in NaHCO3-free inlet solutions. These observations indicate that diopside dissolution rates are unaffected by the simultaneous precipitation of calcite. Calcite likely forms a porous coating on diopside, which allows ions from the dissolving diopside to be transported readily to the bulk fluid. It seems therefore likely that carbonate precipitation will not slow pyroxene dissolution during carbon storage efforts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here, via a novel application of an aggregate Regional Climate Change Index (RCCI) that combines changes in mean annual temperature and precipitation with changes in their interannual variability, we assess multi-dimensional climate changes across the Global 200 ecoregions - a set of priority ecoregions designed to achieve the goal of saving a broad diversity of the Earth's ecosystems - over the 21 st century. Using an ensemble of 62 climate scenarios, our analyses show that, between 1991-2010 and 2081-2100, 96% of the ecoregions considered will be likely (more than 66% probability) to face moderate-to-pronounced climate changes, when compared to the magnitudes of change during the past five decades. Ecoregions at high northern latitudes are projected to experience most pronounced climate change, followed by those in the Mediterranean Basin, Amazon Basin, East Africa, and South Asia. Relatively modest RCCI signals are expected over ecoregions in Northwest South America, West Africa, and Southeast Asia, yet with considerable uncertainties. Although not indicative of climate-change impacts per se, the RCCI-based assessment can help policy-makers gain a quantitative and comprehensive overview of the unevenly distributed climate risks across the G200 ecoregions. Whether due to significant climate change signals or large uncertainties, the ecoregions highlighted in the assessment deserve special attention in more detailed impact assessments to inform effective conservation strategies under future climate change.;;"BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; MEDITERRANEAN BIOME; MOUNTAIN PASSES; PROTECTED AREAS; CHANGE IMPACTS; PROJECTIONS; ECOSYSTEM; ADAPTATION; RESPONSES; FORESTS";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Li, Junsheng; Lin, Xin] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Criteria & Risk Assessment, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xin] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Chen, Anping] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Peterson, Townsend] Univ Kansas, Biodivers Inst, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bertzky, Monika; Kapos, Valerie] United Nations Environm Programme World Conservat, Cambridge, England; [Ciais, Philippe; Poulter, Benjamin] CNRS, LSCE, UM, Commissariat Energie Atom & Energies Alternat CE, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Ciais, Philippe; Poulter, Benjamin] Univ Versailles St Quentin Yvelines UVSQ, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Kapos, Valerie] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge, England; [Peng, Changhui] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Sci, Inst Environm Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Peng, Changhui] NW A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Lab Ecol Forecasting & Global Change, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China";Li, JS (reprint author), Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Criteria & Risk Assessment, Beijing, Peoples R China.;"Canada; France; People's Republic of China; United Kingdom; United States";"Canada; France; People's Republic of China; United Kingdom; United States";"CAN; CHN; FRA; GBR; USA";20;PLOS ONE;;;;;8;1;;;e54839;10.1371/journal.pone.0054839;1932-6203;;;1932-6203;;oui;1;2013;oui;1;2013;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;UMR8212;UMR8212;4 - Excellente

Here, we explored whether recent population trends of species can be explained by their past rate of niche evolution, which can be inferred from increasingly available phylogenetic and niche data. We examined the assemblage of 409 European bird species for which estimates of demographic trends between 1970 and 2000 are available, along with a species-level phylogeny and data on climatic, habitat and trophic niches. We found that species' proneness to demographic decline is associated with slow evolution of the habitat niche in the past, in addition to certain current-day life-history and ecological traits. A similar result was found at a higher taxonomic level, where families prone to decline have had a history of slower evolution of climatic and habitat niches. Our results support the view that niche conservatism can prevent some species from coping with environmental change. Thus, linking patterns of past niche evolution and contemporary species dynamics for large species samples may provide insights into how niche evolution may rescue certain lineages in the face of global change.;"phylogeny; conservation; comparative analyses; Grinnellian niche; Eltonian niche; climatic niche";"CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL; EXTINCTION RISK; CONSERVATION BIOLOGY; PHENOTYPIC EVOLUTION; R PACKAGE; BIRDS; LIFE; SELECTIVITY; DIVERSITY";Biology & Biochemistry;Biology;"[Lavergne, Sebastien; Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Evans, Margaret E.

The primary cause of hypoxia onset in recent decades is human-triggered eutrophication. Global warming has also been demonstrated to contribute to the increase of hypoxic conditions. However, the precise role of both environmental forcings on hypoxia dynamics over the long term remains mainly unknown due to a lack of historical monitoring. In this study, we used an innovative paleolimnological approach on three large European lakes to quantify past hypoxia dynamics and to hierarchies the contributions of climate and nutrients. Even for lake ecosystems that have been well oxygenated over a millennia-long period, and regardless of past climatic fluctuations, a shift to hypoxic conditions occurred in the 1950s in response to an unprecedented rise in total phosphorus concentrations above 105 mu g P L-1. Following this shift, hypoxia never disappeared despite the fact that environmental policies succeeded in drastically reducing lake phosphorus concentrations. During that period, decadal fluctuations in hypoxic volume were great, ranging between 0.5 and 8% of the total lake volumes. We demonstrate, through statistical modeling, that these fluctuations were essentially driven by climatic factors, such as river discharge and air temperature. In lakes Geneva and Bourget, which are fed by large river systems, fluctuations in hypoxic volume were negatively correlated with river discharge. In contrast, the expansion of hypoxia has been related only to warmer air temperatures at Annecy, which is fed by small river systems. Hence, we outline a theoretical framework assuming that restored lake ecosystems have inherited hypoxia from the eutrophication period and have shifted to a new stable state with new key controls of water and ecosystem quality. We suggest that controlling river discharge may be a complementary strategy for local management of lakes fed by large river systems.;"lakes; hypoxia; eutrophication; climate change; Anthropocene; varved sediments";"NW EUROPEAN ALPS; ADDITIVE-MODELS; BOURGET; OXYGEN; EUTROPHICATION; RECONSTRUCTION; CONSEQUENCES; SWITZERLAND; ECOSYSTEMS; SEDIMENTS";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Jenny, Jean-Philippe] Inst Natl Rech Sci, Ctr Eau Terre Environm, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Jenny, Jean-Philippe; Arnaud, Fabien; Sabatier, Pierre] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, CNRS, Le Bourget Du Lac, France; [Jenny, Jean-Philippe; Alric, Benjamin; Dorioz, Jean-Marcel; Perga, Marie-Elodie] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Ctr Alpin Rech Reseaux Troph Ecosyst Limn, INRA, UMR 042, Thonon Les Bains, France; [Alric, Benjamin] Univ Avignon, CNRS IRD, Inst Mediterraneen Biodivers & Ecol Marine & Cont, Marseille, France; [Meybeck, Michel] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Paris, France";Jenny, JP (reprint author), Inst Natl Rech Sci, Ctr Eau Terre Environm, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.;"Canada; France";"Canada; France";"CAN; FRA";0;GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES;;;;;28;12;1413;1423;;10.1002/2014GB004932;0886-6236;1944-9224;;0886-6236 eISSN: 1944-9224;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;Institut méditerranéen de biodiversité et d'écologie marine et continentale (IMBE), UMR7263;Institut méditerranéen de biodiversité et d'écologie marine et continentale (IMBE), UMR7263;UMR7263;UMR7263;5 - Exceptionelle

Charcoal accumulation rates, a proxy for palaeofire records, were obtained in sediment cores from Amazon lakes surrounded by several vegetation types and from a reservoirs in an intense land use change region. The records presented in this study were obtained in the following areas i) a reservoirs in Alta Floresta region (northern Mato Grosso State); ii) Lago do Saci (southern Pars State), a lake close to Alta Floresta and located at the southern border of Para State; iii) a bog in an ecotone area in the Humaita region (southern Amazonas State); iv) lakes in lateritic iron crust of the Carajas Hills (southeastern Para State); v) Lago Comprido, a floodplain lake close to the Amazon River and surrounded by tropical rain forest (Monte Alegre, Para State; vi) Lagoa da Pata in the Morro dos Seis Lagos alkaline complex (Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira, Amazonas State) and vii) Lago Caracarana, a secluded lake in the northern Amazon cerrado (Roraima State). The highest charcoal accumulation rates were observed for modern records related to an intense change in land use at Alta Floresta, which had no precedent during the Holocene history of the Amazon. High charcoal accumulation rates that were observed in the Carajas region during low lake level phases in the Amazon in the mid-Holocene were comparable to those at the onset of the human settlement in Alta Floresta region. An increase in charcoal accumulation rate was observed in the late Holocene when the lake level was high, suggesting an interaction between climates and human presence. Low charcoal accumulation rates are typical of modern high rainfall environments, as observed in Lagoa da Pata where the environment is not susceptible to occurrences of wildfires even during relatively drier climatic phases.

We investigate whether hotspots are quantitatively and qualitatively threatened to the same order of magnitude by the combined effects of global changes. LocationWorldwide, in 34 biodiversity hotspots. MethodsWe quantify (1) the exposure of hotspots to climate change, by estimating the novelty of future climates and the disappearance of extant climates using climate dissimilarity analyses, (2) each hotspot's vulnerability to land modification and degradation by quantifying changes in land-cover variables over the entire habitat, and (3) the future suitability of distribution ranges of 100 of the world's worst invasive alien species', by characterizing the combined effects of climate and land-use changes on the future distribution ranges of these species. ResultsOur findings show that hotspots may experience an average loss of 31% of their area under analogue climate, with some hotspots more affected than others (e.g. Polynesia-Micronesia). The greatest climate change was projected in low-latitude hotspots. The hotspots were on average suitable for 17% of the considered invasive species. Hotspots that are mainly islands or groups of islands were disproportionally suitable for a high number of invasive species both currently and in the future. We also showed that hotspots will increase their area of pasture in the future. Finally, combining the three threats, we identified the Atlantic forest, Cape Floristic Region and Polynesia-Micronesia as particularly vulnerable to global changes. Main conclusionsGiven our estimates of hotspot vulnerability to changes, close monitoring is now required to evaluate the biodiversity responses to future changes and to test our projections against observations.";"Biodiversity hotspots; biological invasions; climate change; conservation; land-use change; spatial prioritization";"SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIOLOGICAL INVASION; AREA RELATIONSHIPS; CONSERVATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; RESPONSES; COMMUNITIES; IMPACTS; FUTURE";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Ecology; Geography, Physical";"[Bellard, Celine; Leclerc, Camille; Leroy, Boris; Courchamp, Franck] Univ Paris 11, CNRS, UMR 8079, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Leroy, Boris] Univ Rennes 1, EA Biodiversite & Gest Terr 7316, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Leroy, Boris] MNHN, Serv Patrimoine Nat, Paris, France; [Bakkenes, Michel] Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy PBL, NL-3720 Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Veloz, Samuel] PRBO Conservat Sci, Petaluma, CA 94954 USA; [Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, FR-38041 Grenoble 9, France";Bellard, C (reprint author), Univ Paris 11, CNRS, UMR 8079, F-91405 Orsay, France.;"France; Netherlands; United States";"France; Netherlands; United States";"FRA; NLD; USA";5;GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY;;;;;23;12;1376;1386;;10.1111/geb.12228;1466-822X;1466-8238;;1466-822X eISSN: 1466-8238;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;"Ecologie, systématique et évolution (ESE), UMR8079; Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553";"Ecologie, systématique et évolution (ESE), UMR8079; Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553";"UMR5553; UMR8079";"UMR5553; UMR8079";5 - Exceptionelle

In most climate impact assessment models and policies, bioenergy systems are assumed to be carbon neutral, thus ignoring the time lag between CO2 emissions from biomass combustion and CO2 uptake by vegetation(5). Here, we show that the temperature peak caused by CO2 emissions from bioenergy is proportional to the maximum rate at which emissions occur and is almost insensitive to cumulative emissions. Whereas the carbon-climate response (CCR; ref. 6) to fossil fuel emissions is approximately constant, the CCR to bioenergy emissions depends on time, biomass turnover times, and emission scenarios. The linearity between temperature peak and bioenergy CO2 emission rates resembles the characteristic of the temperature response to short-lived climate forcers. As for the latter(7-9), the timing of CO2 emissions from bioenergy matters. Under the international agreement to limit global warming to 2 degrees C by 2100(3), early emissions from bioenergy thus have smaller contributions on the targeted temperature than emissions postponed later into the future, especially when bioenergy is sourced from biomass with medium(50-60 years) or long turnover times (100 years).";;"CUMULATIVE CARBON EMISSIONS; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; CLIMATE IMPACTS; SCALE; MITIGATION; BIOFUELS; TARGETS; DIOXIDE; BIOMASS";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Cherubini, Francesco; Bright, Ryan M.; Stromman, Anders H.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Gasser, Thomas] CNRS PontsParisTech EHESS AgroParisTech CIRAD, Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Gasser, Thomas; Ciais, Philippe] CEA CNRS UVSQ, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France";Cherubini, F (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.;"France; Norway";"France; Norway";"FRA; NOR";2;NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE;;;;;4;11;983;987;;10.1038/NCLIMATE2399;1758-678X;1758-6798;;1758-678X eISSN: 1758-6798;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;"Centre international de recherche sur l'environnement et le développement (CIRED), UMR8568; Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"Centre international de recherche sur l'environnement et le développement (CIRED), UMR8568; Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"FR636; UMR8212; UMR8568";"FR636; UMR8212; UMR8568";5 - Exceptionelle

G.

How seasonality varies along latitudinal gradients is not well known in freshwater ecosystems, despite being very important in predicting the effects of climate change and in helping to advance ecological understanding. Stream temperature is often well correlated with air temperature and influences many ecosystem features such as growth and metabolism of most aquatic organisms. We evaluated the degree of seasonality in ten river mouths along a latitudinal gradient for a set of variables, ranging from air and water temperatures, to physical and chemical properties of water and growth of an invasive fish species (eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki). Our results show that although most of the variation in air temperature was explained by latitude and season, this was not the case for water features, including temperature, in lowland Mediterranean streams, which depended less on season and much more on local factors. Similarly, although there was evidence of latitude-dependent seasonality in fish growth, the relationship was nonlinear and weak and the significant latitudinal differences in growth rates observed during winter were compensated later in the year and did not result in overall differences in size and growth. Our results suggest that although latitudinal differences in air temperature cascade through properties of freshwater ecosystems, local factors and complex interactions often override the water temperature variation with latitude and might therefore hinder projections of species distribution models and effects of climate change.;"climate change; Europe; Iberian Peninsula; invasive fish; latitude; river; season";"LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; GAMBUSIA-AFFINIS; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER TEMPERATURE; BERGMANNS RULE; NICHE MODELS; INSECTS; RIVER; SIZE";Environment/Ecology;Ecology;"[Carmona-Catot, Gerard; Santos, Alejandra F.

First, the evolution of rainfall and temperature during the twenty-first century is assessed at the local scale using 17 regional climate model (RCM) simulations. A 15%-30% rainfall reduction is expected in the fall combined with a 7%-9% annual reduction by 2030-50. Based on a regression model relating yields to rainfall, residual yields (independent of the increasing trend in the present period and from the biennial fruit bearing of the olive tree) are projected to decrease by 7% and 3.5% by 2030-50 for rainfed and irrigated olive groves, respectively. Substantial uncertainties in these results are discussed. A GIS analysis shows a reduction of ground and surface water resources, which are the basis of the present adaptation to rainfall variability, and an uneven potential for adaptation to climate change in the Sierra Magina region. Despite the important challenges faced by this rural region, there is no consensus among the local key actors regarding adaptation strategies. This is due in part to the diversity among farmers, but also to the different levels of awareness about climate change among all the stakeholders and farmers. Since the projected decline in medium-range future yields is not very high, there might be time and possibilities, especially in the northern part of the Sierra Magina, to build a local adaptability strategy within the next 20 years that would take into account improved methods of water management and a better economic valorization of olive oil. But at longer time scales, the adaptability of the olive-growing system to yield and water resource declines seems to be threatened.;;"MODEL PROJECTIONS; SOUTHERN SPAIN; SLOPING LAND; CROP YIELD; ANDALUSIA; VULNERABILITY; VARIABILITY; TRENDS";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Social Sciences";"Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Ronchail, Josyane] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Univ Paris 04, UMR Locean,UPMC,CNRS,IRD,MNHN, F-75205 Paris 13, France; [Cohen, Marianne; Angles, Stephane] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR Ladyss, F-75205 Paris 13, France; [Alonso-Roldan, Maria] Pasos, Participac & Sostenibilidad, Granada, Spain; [Garcin, Helene] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75205 Paris 13, France; [Sultan, Benjamin] UP6, CNRS, IRD, LOCEAN,UMR 7159,MNHN, Paris, France";Cohen, M (reprint author), Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR Ladyss, 5 Rue Thomas Mann,Case Courrier 7001, F-75205 Paris 13, France.;"France; Spain";"France; Spain";"ESP; FRA";1;WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY;;;;;6;4;451;467;;10.1175/WCAS-D-12-00045.1;1948-8327;1948-8335;;1948-8327 eISSN: 1948-8335;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;"Laboratoire d'Océanographie et du Climat : Expérimentations et Approches Numériques (LOCEAN), UMR7159; Laboratoire dynamiques sociales et recomposition des espaces (LADYSS), UMR7533";"Laboratoire d'Océanographie et du Climat : Expérimentations et Approches Numériques (LOCEAN), UMR7159; Laboratoire dynamiques sociales et recomposition des espaces (LADYSS), UMR7533";"UMR7159; UMR7533";"UMR7159; UMR7533";3 - Correcte

Many temperate tree species experience a wide range of environmental conditions, suggesting high adaptability to new environmental conditions. We investigated adaptation to regional climate in the drought-sensitive tree species Alnus glutinosa (Black alder), using a complementary approach that integrates genomic, phenotypic and landscape data. A total of 24 European populations were studied in a common garden and through landscape genomic approaches. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to identify SNPs across the genome, resulting in 1990 SNPs. Although a relatively low percentage of putative adaptive SNPs was detected (2.86% outlier SNPs), we observed clear associations among outlier allele frequencies, temperature and plant traits. In line with the typical drought avoiding nature of A.glutinosa, leaf size varied according to a temperature gradient and significant associations with multiple outlier loci were observed, corroborating the ecological relevance of the observed outlier SNPs. Moreover, the lack of isolation by distance, the very low genetic differentiation among populations and the high intrapopulation genetic variation all support the notion that high gene exchange combined with strong environmental selection promotes adaptation to environmental cues.;"adaptation; climate change; contemporary evolution; natural selection; quantitative genetics";"RAPID CLIMATE-CHANGE; LOCAL ADAPTATION; GENE FLOW; NATURAL-SELECTION; SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; LEAF PHENOLOGY; AQUATIC PLANT; FOREST TREES; POPULATION; EVOLUTIONARY";"Biology & Biochemistry; Environment/Ecology; Molecular Biology & Genetics; Plant & Animal Science";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";"[De Kort, Hanne; Vandepitte, Katrien; Honnay, Olivier] Univ Leuven, Dept Biol, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Bruun, Hans Henrik] Univ Copenhagen, Ecol & Evolut Sect, Dept Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Closset-Kopp, Deborah] Jules Vernes Univ Picardy, Res Unit Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises, F-80037 Amiens, France; [Mergeay, Joachim] Res Inst Nat & Forest, B-9500 Geraardsbergen, Belgium";De Kort, H (reprint author), Univ Leuven, Dept Biol, Kasteelpk Arenberg 31, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.;"Belgium; Denmark; France";"Belgium; Denmark; France";"BEL; DNK; FRA";4;MOLECULAR ECOLOGY;;;;;23;19;4709;4721;;10.1111/mec.12813;0962-1083;1365-294X;;0962-1083 eISSN: 1365-294X;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;Ecologie et dynamique des systèmes anthropisés (EDYSAN), FRE3498;Ecologie et dynamique des systèmes anthropisés (EDYSAN), FRE3498;FRE3498;FRE3498;5 - Exceptionelle

A.; Schmalholz, S. M.";LITHOSPHERE Volume: 6 Issue: 5 Pages: 303-318 Published: 2014;English;Article;The elevation of continental interiors over time is demonstrably variable. A major part of change in elevation within the continental interior is likely driven by density changes within the upper mantle and by global mantle convection. For example, upper-mantle flow has been invoked as the cause of Neogene uplift of the interior Rocky Mountains and Colorado Plateau, warping and tilting sediment transport slopes that link to the widespread deposition of gravel units within the Great Plains. These geomorphic and sedimentologic features, however, can also be generated by an increase in runoff, since erosion will promote change in elevation due to isostatic compensation and the loading of the lithosphere by the deposition of sediment. To explore the consequences of change in topography and climate, we use a general length-dependent diffusive sediment transport law to model both erosion and deposition that includes the concentrative effects of river systems. The simplicity of the approach means that we can collapse sediment transport to one dimension and couple erosion and deposition with plate flexure. We find that for a landscape that is gently tilted (slope of order of 10(-3)), a change in runoff has a minor effect on transport gradient, as sediment transport and associated flexural response maintain topography at a similar elevation. However, there can be a significant change in depositional style when the degree of tilt is altered by, for example, a local change in upper-mantle density. An increase in buoyancy within the upper mantle, which increases slopes, leads to a transient reduction in grain sizes deposited at a fixed location. This behavior is due to a temporary retreat of the zone of erosion into the catchment and a transient increase in accommodation space relative to sediment supply. A reduction in tilt has the opposite effect, the older deposits are eroded, and the erosion-deposition transition rapidly moves down system. There is convincing evidence that the formation of thin and laterally extensive conglomeratic units of the Great Plains was due to a reduced rate of subsidence. Based on the results of our model, we suggest that the deposition of widespread conglomeratic units within continental interiors is generally a consequence of a reduction in slope, as the dynamic support for regions of high topography is reduced.;;"WESTERN GREAT-PLAINS; RIO-GRANDE RIFT; ROCKY-MOUNTAINS; NEW-MEXICO; STRATIGRAPHIC MODEL; GRAVEL PROGRADATION; COLORADO PLATEAU; FORELAND BASINS; RIVER INCISION; NORTH-AMERICA";Geosciences;"Geochemistry & Geophysics; Geology";"[Armitage, J.

Recently extracted sediment cores yielded a number of Middle Stone Age (MSA) artefacts, prompting exploratory excavation of the sediments to understand better the geomorphology of the site, age of the sediments, cultural lithic sequence, vegetation and faunal remains, and to try to establish whether human use of the site was to some extent climatically driven. Excavations yielded late Pleistocene mammal fauna and flora, and three small MSA lithic assemblages with age estimates of 30 ka, >45 ka and 138.01 +/- 7.7 ka. The upper layers comprise peat that preserves macrobotanical and faunal remains, implying local fen conditions in Acacia savanna woodland at 12 ka. Below the upper peat layers, a 1 m-thick layer of white sand yielded two MSA lithic assemblages in association with faunal remains dated to between 30.8 +/- 0.7 ka and >45 ka. Clay underlying the sand has an OSL age of 63.1 +/- 5.8 ka, and sandy peat below it has an Infrared Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL) age of 70 +/- 10 ka. Faunal remains in the lower sand levels, and dental stable carbon isotope analysis of herbivores, indicate a substantial grassland component in the landscape during late MIS 3 (>45 ka). Charcoal, phytolith and pollen data show a change from moderately warm and dry grassy savanna woodland in the lower sand levels, to cooler and wetter grassland with woody shrubs in the uppermost levels by 30 ka. The conditions that resulted in the deposition of the sand also attracted people to the site, but whether it served as an oasis in an arid landscape, or was occupied during wet phases, is unclear. The composition of the lithic assemblages, which include many tools suitable for cutting, suggest that the peat mound may have been used as a place to harvest reeds, process plant materials and butcher animals that were either deliberately or accidentally trapped in mud or peat.

In our model, the reduction of CO2 concentration occurs through the carbon capture and storage process, rather than through the adoption of cleaner technologies. Furthermore, we first provide the explicit short-run dynamics for this dynamic game with symmetric open-loop and a special Markovian Nash strategy. Then, we compare these strategies at the games' steady states and along some balanced growth paths. Our results show that if the initial level of CO2 is relatively high, state dependent emissions reductions can lead to higher overall environmental quality, hence, feedback strategy leads to less social waste.

Because plant regeneration from seeds may be particularly vulnerable, here we assess the possible effects of climate change on seed characteristics and present an integrated analysis of seven seed traits (nutrient concentrations, samara mass, seed mass, wing length, seed viability, germination percentage, and seedling biomass) of Acer platanoides and A. pseudoplatanus seeds collected along a wide latitudinal gradient from Italy to Norway. Seed traits were analyzed in relation to the environmental conditions experienced by the mother trees along the latitudinal gradient. We found that seed traits of A. platanoides were more influenced by the climatic conditions than those of A. pseudoplatanus. Additionally, seed viability, germination percentage, and seedling biomass of A. platanoides were strongly related to the seed mass and nutrient concentration. While A. platanoides seeds were more influenced by the environmental conditions (generally negatively affected by rising temperatures), compared to A. pseudoplatanus, A. platanoides still showed higher germination percentage and seedling biomass than A. pseudoplatanus. Thus, further research on subsequent life-history stages of both species is needed.

To do so, we constitute a meta-database made of 19 studies and 301 future runoff change values. The future tendency in streamflow developments is overall very uncertain (median of the 301 points is 0% and mean +5.2%), except for (i) the Gambia River, which exhibits a significant negative change (median= -4.5%), and (ii) the Sassandra and the Niger rivers, where the change is positive (+14.4% and +6.1%). A correlation analysis revealed that runoff changes are tightly linked to changes in rainfall (R = 0.49), and to a smaller extent also to changes in potential evapotranspiration. Other parameters than climate - such as the carbon effect on plant water efficiency, land use dynamics or water withdrawals - could also significantly impact on runoff, but they generally do not offset the effects of climate change. In view of the potential changes, the large uncertainty therein and the high vulnerability of the region to such changes, there is an urgent need for integrated studies that quantify the potential effects of these processes on water resources in West Africa and for more accuracy in climate models rainfall projections. We especially underline the lack of information concerning projections of future floods and droughts, and of interannual fluctuations in streamflow.;;"GLOBAL WATER-RESOURCES; RIVER-BASINS; NAKAMBE RIVER; NIGER RIVER; LAND-USE; STREAMFLOW; FUTURE; VARIABILITY; DISCHARGE; MODEL";"Engineering; Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Water Resources";"[Roudier, P.; Feyen, L.] EC, JRC, IES, Climate & Risk Management Unit, Ispra, Italy; [Ducharne, A.] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, UMR7619, Lab METIS, Paris, France";Roudier, P (reprint author), EC, JRC, IES, Climate & Risk Management Unit, Ispra, Italy.;"France; Italy";"France; Italy";"FRA; ITA";0;HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES;;;;;18;7;2789;2801;;10.5194/hess-18-2789-2014;1027-5606;1607-7938;;1027-5606 eISSN: 1607-7938;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;Milieux Environnementaux, Transferts et Interactions dans les hydrosystèmes et les Sols (METIS), UMR7619;Milieux Environnementaux, Transferts et Interactions dans les hydrosystèmes et les Sols (METIS), UMR7619;UMR7619;UMR7619;5 - Exceptionelle

Here, we review the literature to disentangle the actions of evolutionary changes in response to selection induced by climate change versus changes due to individual plasticity, that is, the capacity of an individual to adjust its phenology to environmental variables. Within the abundant literature on climate change effects on bird phenology, only a small fraction of studies are based on individual data, yet individual data are required to quantify the relative importance of plastic versus evolutionary responses. While plasticity seems common and often adaptive, no study so far has provided direct evidence for an evolutionary response of bird phenology to current climate change. This assessment leads us to notice the alarming lack of tests for microevolutionary changes in bird phenology in response to climate change, in contrast with the abundant claims on this issue. In short, at present we cannot draw reliable conclusions on the processes underlying the observed patterns of advanced phenology in birds. Rapid improvements in techniques for gathering and analysing individual data offer exciting possibilities that should encourage research activity to fill this knowledge gap.;"bird; climate change; evolution; phenology; phenotypic plasticity; selection; timing of breeding; timing of migration";"WILD BIRD POPULATION; TIT PARUS-MAJOR; QUANTITATIVE-GENETIC-ANALYSIS; SPRING ARRIVAL DATE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; GREAT TIT; NATURAL-SELECTION; REACTION NORMS; COMMON TERNS; LAYING DATE";"Biology & Biochemistry; Plant & Animal Science";Evolutionary Biology;"[Charmantier, Anne] UMR 5175, Ctr Ecol Fonctionnelle & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Gienapp, Phillip] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands";Charmantier, A (reprint author), UMR 5175, Ctr Ecol Fonctionnelle & Evolut, Campus CNRS,1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.;"France; Netherlands";"France; Netherlands";"FRA; NLD";18;EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS;;;;;7;1;15;28;;10.1111/eva.12126;1752-4571;;;1752-4571;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175;Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175;UMR5175;UMR5175;4 - Excellente

However, notwithstanding the potential for triggering notable (felt) seismic events, the potential for buoyancy-driven CO2 to reach potable groundwater and the ground surface is actually more important from public safety and storage-efficiency perspectives. In this context, this work extends the previous studies on the geomechanical modeling of fault responses during underground carbon dioxide injection, focusing on the short-term integrity of the sealing caprock, and hence on the potential for leakage of either brine or CO2 to reach the shallow groundwater aquifers during active injection. We consider stress/strain-dependent permeability and study the leakage through the fault zone as its permeability changes during a reactivation, also causing seismicity. We analyze several scenarios related to the volume of CO2 injected (and hence as a function of the overpressure), involving both minor and major faults, and analyze the profile risks of leakage for different stress/strain-permeability coupling functions. We conclude that whereas it is very difficult to predict how much fault permeability could change upon reactivation, this process can have a significant impact on the leakage rate. Moreover, our analysis shows that induced seismicity associated with fault reactivation may not necessarily open up a new flow path for leakage. Results show a poor correlation between magnitude and amount of fluid leakage, meaning that a single event is generally not enough to substantially change the permeability along the entire fault length. Consequently, even if some changes in permeability occur, this does not mean that the CO2 will migrate up along the entire fault, breaking through the caprock to enter the overlying aquifer.

Its strategic situation with respect to surface water resources encourages the investigation of the climate change impacts projected by climate models. The goal of this study is first to compare the observed precipitation with climate model outputs, and then to evaluate the future changes projected by different climate models. The study area is subdivided into four regions: the upstream and downstream transboundary Medjerda basin, the northern coastal basins and the eastern coastal basins. A database provided by the Tunisian hydrological service includes 388 stations with complete monthly precipitation data over the period 1961-2000. An ensemble of Regional Climate Models (RCM) simulations provided by the European Union-funded project ENSEMBLES are used. Six RCM model runs (CNR-A, DMI-A, DMI-B, ICT-E, SMH-B and SMH-E) are analysed, for the control period 1961-2000 and two projection periods, 2011-2050 and 2051-2090. The models efficiency in reproducing seasonal precipitation amounts and variability is evaluated. A 1-km monthly precipitation reference grid is computed through the interpolation of rainfall observations during the period 1961-2000 with kriging techniques. Monthly precipitation series averaged over the four basins are built for comparison during the control period. The RCM outputs are evaluated with respect to the annual precipitation cycle and rainfall frequency distribution using robust statistics. For the control period, features of the seasonal regimes are well reproduced by all models. It is found that models underestimate seasonal precipitation on average by 20%. The discrepancy between model outputs and observations depends on the season. For the future, in summer and autumn the different models do not project major changes in the seasonal distributions. However, for winter and spring, all the models project a significant decrease of precipitations.

We sampled above-ground plant material from spring regrowth and summer regrowth of a climate change experiment. While in spring, the plants were well watered, the summer regrowth was exposed to drought and elevated temperature (+3 A degrees C) by infrared heating of the canopy during 3 weeks. We assessed the elemental and isotopic composition, lignin and non-cellulosic carbohydrate content and composition of plant material grown under all three conditions. Its mineralization potential in soil and priming effects were evaluated during laboratory incubation. Warming had no significant effect on elemental and stable isotope composition of both plant materials. In contrast, it resulted in reduction of lignin content for both plant species and decrease of the lignin-to-N ratio for F. arundinacea and increased non-cellulosic carbohydrate content for D. glomerata. Summer regrowth was characterised by increase of delta C-13 values, which is consistent with variations in stomatal conductance due to water shortage. Moreover, summer drought induced an increase in N content leading to decrease of the C/N ratio and increase of lignin-to-N ratio of summer regrowth compared to spring regrowth. Differences in decomposition were small, while priming effects were more strongly altered by the different exposure to enviromental. Our results provide direct experimental evidence that extreme climatic events (high temperature and precipitation deficit) have an influence on soil carbon storage particularly through their effect on priming of native soil organic matter induced by altered plant litter. These effects seem to be governed by alterations of stoichiometry and to a smaller extent by alterations of plant chemical composition.;"Drought; Elevated temperature; Plant biochemical composition; VSC lignin; Non-cellulosic sugars; Priming effect";"OXIDE OXIDATION-PRODUCTS; TALL FESCUE; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; WATER RELATIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; N-DEPOSITION; ECOSYSTEM; QUALITY; STRESS";"Agricultural Sciences; Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science";"[Sanaullah, Muhammad; Chabbi, Abad; Girardin, Cyril; Rumpel, Cornelia] Univ Paris 06, BIOEMCO, CNRS, INRA, Thiverval Grignon, France; [Sanaullah, Muhammad] Univ Agr Faisalabad, ISES, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Chabbi, Abad; Durand, Jean-Louis; Poirier, Magalie] INRA, URP3F, F-86600 Lusignan, France";Chabbi, A (reprint author), INRA, URP3F, F-86600 Lusignan, France.;"France; Pakistan";"France; Pakistan";"FRA; PAK";1;PLANT AND SOIL;;;;;374;1-2;767;778;;10.1007/s11104-013-1890-y;0032-079X;1573-5036;;0032-079X eISSN: 1573-5036;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;Institut d'écologie et des sciences de l'environnement de Paris (IEES), UMR7618;Institut d'écologie et des sciences de l'environnement de Paris (IEES), UMR7618;UMR7618;UMR7618;4 - Excellente

When a given host country allows more immigrants in, this creates costs and benefits for that particular country as well as a positive externality for individuals and governments who care about world poverty. Host countries quite often restrict immigration due to its important social and political costs, however these costs are never measured and made comparable across countries. In this paper we first show theoretically that tradable immigration quotas (TIQs) can reveal countries' comparative advantages in hosting immigrants and - once coupled with a matching mechanism taking migrants' preferences over destinations and countries' preferences over migrants' types into account allow for exploiting them efficiently. We then discuss three potential applications: a market for the resettlement of international refugees, a market for the resettlement of migrants displaced by climate change, and the creation of an OECD poverty-reduction visa program adapted from the US green card lottery.

The positive summer trend in the SAM over recent decades is widely attributed to stratospheric ozone depletion(2); however, the brevity of observational records from Antarctica(1)-one of the core zones that defines SAM variability-limits our understanding of long-term SAM behaviour. Here we reconstruct annual mean changes in the SAM since AD 1000 using, for the first time, proxy records that encompass the full mid-latitude to polar domain across the Drake Passage sector. We find that the SAM has undergone a progressive shift towards its positive phase since the fifteenth century, causing cooling of the main Antarctic continent at the same time that the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed. The positive trend in the SAM since similar to AD 1940 is reproduced by multimodel climate simulations forced with rising greenhouse gas levels and later ozone depletion, and the long-term average SAM index is now at its highest level for at least the past 1,000 years. Reconstructed SAM trends before the twentieth century are more prominent than those in radiative-forcing climate experiments and may be associated with a teleconnected response to tropical Pacific climate. Our findings imply that predictions of further greenhouse-driven increases in the SAM over the coming century(3) also need to account for the possibility of opposing effects from tropical Pacific climate changes.";;"CLIMATE FORCING RECONSTRUCTIONS; LAST MILLENNIUM; PMIP SIMULATIONS; TEMPERATURE; 20TH-CENTURY; VARIABILITY; TRENDS; ICE; IMPACT; CMIP5";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Abram, Nerilie J.; Mulvaney, Robert; Turner, John] British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Abram, Nerilie J.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Vimeux, Francoise] Inst Rech Dev, Lab HydroSci Montpellier, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Vimeux, Francoise] Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Phipps, Steven J.; England, Matthew H.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Phipps, Steven J.; England, Matthew H.] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia";Abram, NJ (reprint author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.;"Australia; France; United Kingdom";"Australia; France; United Kingdom";"AUS; FRA; GBR";11;NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE;;;;;4;7;564;569;;10.1038/NCLIMATE2235;1758-678X;1758-6798;;1758-678X eISSN: 1758-6798;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;"HydroSciences Montpellier (HSM), UMR5569; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"HydroSciences Montpellier (HSM), UMR5569; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"UMR5569; UMR8212";"UMR5569; UMR8212";5 - Exceptionelle

The main drivers of spatial variability in net ecosystem production (NEP) on a global scale are, however, poorly known. As increasing nutrient availability increases the production of biomass per unit of photosynthesis(2) and reduces heterotrophic(3) respiration in forests, we expected nutrients to determine carbon sequestration in forests. Our synthesis study of 92 forests in different climate zones revealed that nutrient availability indeed plays a crucial role in determining NEP and ecosystem carbon-use efficiency (CUEe; that is, the ratio of NEP to gross primary production (GPP)). Forests with high GPP exhibited high NEP only in nutrient-rich forests (CUEe = 33 +/- 4%; mean +/- s.e.m.). In nutrient-poor forests, a much larger proportion of GPP was released through ecosystem respiration, resulting in lower CUEe (6 +/- 4%). Our finding that nutrient availability exerts a stronger control on NEP than on carbon input (GPP) conflicts with assumptions of nearly all global coupled carbon cycle-climate models, which assume that carbon inputs through photosynthesis drive biomass production and carbon sequestration. An improved global understanding of nutrient availability would therefore greatly improve carbon cycle modelling and should become a critical focus for future research.";;"SPATIAL VARIABILITY; RESPIRATION; ECOSYSTEMS; BIOMASS; EFFICIENCY; BOREAL; STOCKS";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Fernandez-Martinez, M.; Sardans, J.; Penuelas, J.] CREAF CSIC UAB, Global Ecol Unit, CSIC, Barcelona 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Fernandez-Martinez, M.; Sardans, J.; Roda, F.; Penuelas, J.] CREAF, Barcelona 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Vicca, S.; Janssens, I.

Deep-sea life is primarily reliant on the export flux of particulate organic carbon from the surface ocean for food, but most ocean biogeochemistry models predict global decreases in export flux resulting from 21st century anthropogenically induced warming. Here we show that decadal-to-century scale changes in carbon export associated with climate change lead to an estimated 5.2% decrease in future (2091-2100) global open ocean benthic biomass under RCP8.5 (reduction of 5.2 Mt C) compared with contemporary conditions (2006-2015). Our projections use multi-model mean export flux estimates from eight fully coupled earth system models, which contributed to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, that have been forced by high and low representative concentration pathways (RCP8.5 and 4.5, respectively). These export flux estimates are used in conjunction with published empirical relationships to predict changes in benthic biomass. The polar oceans and some upwelling areas may experience increases in benthic biomass, but most other regions show decreases, with up to 38% reductions in parts of the northeast Atlantic. Our analysis projects a future ocean with smaller sized infaunal benthos, potentially reducing energy transfer rates though benthic multicellular food webs. More than 80% of potential deep-water biodiversity hotspots known around the world, including canyons, seamounts, and cold-water coral reefs, are projected to experience negative changes in biomass. These major reductions in biomass may lead to widespread change in benthic ecosystems and the functions and services they provide.;"benthic; deep-sea; macroecology; macrofauna; megafauna; meiofaunal; size structure; standing stock";"ABYSSAL NORTHEAST PACIFIC; GULF-OF-MEXICO; DEEP-SEA; BODY-SIZE; BACTERIAL ABUNDANCE; EXPORT PRODUCTION; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; OPEN-OCEAN; FISHERIES; MODEL";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Jones, Daniel O.

Here, we investigate changes in the elevational distribution of dung beetle species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) in two separate mountain regions in Europe. Location South-western Alps (France) and Sierra Nevada (Spain). Methods We compared historical and current data on dung beetle distributions along elevation gradients for 30 species in the SW Alps and 19 species in the Sierra Nevada. We tested for significant changes between survey periods in three parameters: mean elevation and upper and lower range limits. Results We found up-slope range shifts for 63% and 90% of the species in the SW Alps and Sierra Nevada, respectively. Up-slope range shifts resulted mainly from expansion of upper range limits in the SW Alps and from changes of both range limits in the Sierra Nevada. The magnitudes of range shifts were consistent with the level of warming experienced in each region, but they also reflected the asymmetrical warming observed along the elevation gradients. Smaller changes were observed for species reaching their historical range limits at the higher elevations, associated with a non-significant increase in temperature between periods. Main conclusions The differences observed between regions are related to the geographical position of each mountain range, which determines the characteristics (including thermal tolerance) of the regional species pool, and the level of warming, which determines whether maximum thermal tolerance has been exceeded for the majority of species in the region. Our results highlight the importance of considering both the biogeography of the mountain and the species pool under study when assessing the sensitivity of species to future climate change in mountain regions.;"south-western Alps; range shifts; Climate change; Sierra Nevada; elevational gradients; dung beetles";"SCARABAEOIDEA COL COMMUNITIES; SPECIES RICHNESS DISTRIBUTION; BAITED PITFALL TRAPS; NATURAL REFORESTATION; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; ALPINE PLANT; COLEOPTERA; HABITAT; SCARABAEINAE; DIVERSITY";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Ecology; Geography, Physical";"[Menendez, Rosa] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Gonzalez-Megias, Adela] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Zool, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Jay-Robert, Pierre] Univ Montpellier 3, Dept Dynam & Gouvernance Syst Ecol, CNRS, UMR 5175,CEFE, F-34199 Montpellier 5, France; [Marquez-Ferrando, Rocio] CSIC, Dept Wetland Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, Seville 41092, Spain";Menendez, R (reprint author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr LEC 1, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, Lancs, England.;"France; Spain; United Kingdom";"France; Spain; United Kingdom";"ESP; FRA; GBR";8;GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY;;;;;23;6;646;657;;10.1111/geb.12142;1466-822X;1466-8238;;1466-822X eISSN: 1466-8238;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175;Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175;UMR5175;UMR5175;5 - Exceptionelle

It is an integrated analysis from cause to consequence, including the whole chain of processes starting from earthquake inception in the subsurface, wave propagation toward the ground surface, and assessment of the consequences of ground vibration. For a small magnitude (M-w = 3) event at a hypocenter depth of about 1000 m, we first used the simulated ground-motion wave train in an inverse analysis to estimate source parameters (moment magnitude, rupture dimensions and stress drop), achieving good agreement and thereby verifying the modeling of the chain of processes from earthquake inception to ground vibration. We then analyzed the ground vibration results in terms of peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV) and frequency content, with comparison to U.S. Geological Survey's instrumental intensity scales for earthquakes and the U.S. Bureau of Mines' vibration criteria for cosmetic damage to buildings, as well as human-perception vibration limits. Our results confirm the appropriateness of using PGV (rather than PGA) and frequency for the evaluation of potential ground-vibration effects on structures and humans from shallow injection-induced seismic events. For the considered synthetic M-w = 3 event, our analysis showed that the short duration, high frequency ground motion may not cause any significant damage to surface structures, but would certainly be felt by the local population.

It includes research on several sections, in particular the key sections of Golbey-Pre Droue and Thornich-Hochrech (located in the vicinity of the Vosges Massif and in the Rhenish Massif, respectively), and the use of the Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating method. Our investigations made it possible to obtain a more robust chronostratigraphical framework and to update the previous model of fluvial response to climate change. The results demonstrate that the Moselle terrace M3 (first terrace formed after the capture of the Upper Moselle by the Palaeo-Meurthe) has the same age from the Vosges to the Rhenish Massif. The formation of this terrace included two main periods of sedimentation attributed to the Late Saalian (MIS 6) and the Early Weichselian (MIS 5), respectively. They were separated by a major episode of fluvial erosion that may be allocated to the MIS 6-5 transition on the basis of chronological and sedimentological evidence. This erosion led to the removal of most of the MIS 6 deposits, whereas the MIS 5 deposits have been widely preserved following the subsequent (MIS 5-4) terrace incision. This evolution somewhat contrasts with that observed in the Sarre valley, the main tributary of the Moselle, and with many fluvial systems in western Europe, which show better preservation of deposits from cold periods. This atypical behaviour is explained by the relationship between the fluvial evolution and the glaciers covering the upper Moselle catchment (Vosges Massif) during the Pleistocene cold periods.;;"PLEISTOCENE EVOLUTION; SYSTEM RESPONSE; RHENISH-MASSIF; PARIS BASIN; ICE-AGE; LUMINESCENCE; DEPOSITS; RIVER; FELDSPAR; SINGLE";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary";"[Cordier, Stephane] Univ Paris Est Creteil, Univ Paris 01, Dept Geog, UMR 8591,CNRS, F-94010 Creteil, France; [Cordier, Stephane; Frechen, Manfred] LIAG, Sect Geochronol & Isotope Hydrol, D-30655 Hannover, Germany; [Harmand, Dominique] Univ Lorraine, Lab LOTERR, F-54000 Nancy, France";Cordier, S (reprint author), Univ Paris Est Creteil, Univ Paris 01, Dept Geog, UMR 8591,CNRS, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle, F-94010 Creteil, France.;"France; Germany";"France; Germany";"DEU; FRA";3;BOREAS;;;;;43;2;450;468;;10.1111/bor.12057;0300-9483;1502-3885;;0300-9483 eISSN: 1502-3885;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;Laboratoire de Géographie Physique : Environnements Quaternaires et Actuels (LGP), UMR8591;Laboratoire de Géographie Physique : Environnements Quaternaires et Actuels (LGP), UMR8591;UMR8591;UMR8591;3 - Correcte

Tremendous efforts have been made to develop ever more sophisticated species distribution models to provide forecasts for the future of biodiversity. All these models rely on species occurrence data, either for calibration or validation. Here we evaluate (i) whether distribution data diverge among widely used sources, for supposedly well-known taxa, and (ii) to what extent these divergences affect species distribution models. Location Europe (as an example). Methods We compared the distribution maps of 21 of the most common European trees, according to four large-scale, putatively reliable sources of distribution data. For each species, we compared the outputs of correlative species distribution models built using occurrence data from each of these sources of data. We also investigated how discrepancies in large-scale occurrence data affected the validation scores of two process-based tree distribution models. Results Maps of tree occurrence diverged in 8-74% of the forested area, depending on species. These discrepancies affected projections of niche models: for example, 22-75% of the area projected as suitable by at least one model generated using one source of data was not projected as such by all other models. For most species, this proportion increased under scenarios of climate change, whatever the model used. To a lesser extent, uncertainties on current species distributions also affect the validation score of process-based distribution models. Main conclusions Reliable, widely used sources of occurrence data strongly diverge even for well-known taxa - the most common European trees. Scientists and stakeholders should acknowledge this gap in knowledge, since accurate data are a prerequisite to providing stakeholders with robust forecasts on biodiversity. Participatory science programmes and remote sensing techniques are promising tools for rapidly gathering such data.;"species occurrence data; uncertainty; species distribution models; European forest trees; Climate change; model robustness";"DISTRIBUTION MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CITIZEN SCIENCE; GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY; ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; VEGETATION MODEL; TREE; RANGE; UNCERTAINTY; PREDICTIONS";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Ecology; Geography, Physical";"[Duputie, Anne; Chuine, Isabelle] CEFE UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Zimmermann, Niklaus E.] WSL, Swiss Fed Res Inst, Landscape Dynam Unit, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland";Duputie, A (reprint author), Univ Lille 1, CNRS, Lab Genet & Evolut Populat Vegetales, UMR 8198, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France.;"France; Switzerland";"France; Switzerland";"CHE; FRA";7;GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY;;;;;23;4;457;467;;10.1111/geb.12118;1466-822X;1466-8238;;1466-822X eISSN: 1466-8238;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;"Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175; Evolution, Ecologie et Paléontologie (Evo-Eco-Paleo), UMR8198";"Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175; Evolution, Ecologie et Paléontologie (Evo-Eco-Paleo), UMR8198";"UMR5175; UMR8198";"UMR5175; UMR8198";5 - Exceptionelle

We used an altitudinal gradient to simulate a year-round warmer and drier climate for semi-natural subalpine grasslands across a landscape of contrasting land-use management. Turf mesocosms from three pasture-woodland land-use types-unwooded pasture, sparsely wooded pasture, and densely wooded pasture-spanning a gradient from high to low management intensity were transplanted downslope to test their resistance to two intensities of climate change. We found strong overall effects of intensive (+4 K) experimental climate change (i.e., warming and reduced precipitation) on plant community structure and function, while moderate (+2 K) climate change did not substantially affect the studied land-use types, thus indicating an ecosystem response threshold to moderate climate perturbation. The individual land-use types were affected differently under the +4 K scenario, with a 60 % decrease in aboveground biomass (AGB) in unwooded pasture turfs, a 40 % decrease in sparsely wooded pasture turfs, and none in densely wooded ones. Similarly, unwooded pasture turfs experienced a 30 % loss of species, advanced (by 30 days) phenological development, and a mid-season senescence due to drought stress, while no such effects were recorded for the other land-use types. The observed contrasting effects of climate change across the pasture-woodland landscape have important implications for future decades. The reduced impact of climate change on wooded pastures as compared to unwooded ones should promote the sustainable land use of wooded pastures by maintaining low management intensity and a sparse forest canopy, which buffer the immediate impacts of climate change on herbaceous vegetation.;"Climate change; Land use; C-13; NDVI; Plant species richness; Plant growth form; Transplantation; Gradient; Mesocosm";"CARBON ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; LAND-USE CHANGES; MANIPULATION EXPERIMENTS; MOUNTAIN VEGETATION; PLANT DIVERSITY; EUROPEAN ALPS; ECOSYSTEMS; GRASSLANDS; RESPONSES; DROUGHT";Environment/Ecology;Ecology;"[Gavazov, Konstantin; Spiegelberger, Thomas; Buttler, Alexandre] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Ecol Syst ECOS, Stn 2, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Gavazov, Konstantin; Buttler, Alexandre] WSL Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, Res Unit Community Ecol, Stn 2, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Spiegelberger, Thomas] UR EMGR Mt Ecosyst, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Buttler, Alexandre] Univ Franche Comte, UMR Chronoenvironm 6249, CNRS, F-25030 Besancon, France";Gavazov, K (reprint author), WSL Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, Res Unit Community Ecol, Stn 2, Site Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.;"France; Switzerland";"France; Switzerland";"CHE; FRA";4;OECOLOGIA;;;;;174;4;1425;1435;;10.1007/s00442-013-2839-9;0029-8549;1432-1939;;0029-8549 eISSN: 1432-1939;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;Chrono-environnement, UMR6249;Chrono-environnement, UMR6249;UMR6249;UMR6249;3 - Correcte

In recent years, the grounding line, which separates the grounded ice sheet from the floating ice shelf, has retreated by tens of kilometres(5). At present, the grounding line is crossing a retrograde bedrock slope that lies well below sea level, raising the possibility that the glacier is susceptible to the marine ice-sheet instability mechanism(6-8). Here, using three state-of-the-art ice-flow models(9-11), we show that Pine Island Glacier's grounding line is probably engaged in an unstable 40 km retreat. The associated mass loss increases substantially over the course of our simulations from the average value of 20 Gt yr(-1) observed for the 1992-2011 period(4), up to and above 100 Gt yr(-1), equivalent to 3.5-10mm eustatic sea-level rise over the following 20 years.

The Sahara is the largest warm desert in the world and together with the arid Sahel displays high topographical and climatic heterogeneity, and has experienced recent and strong climatic oscillations that have greatly shifted biodiversity distribution and community composition. The large size, remoteness and long-term political instability of the Sahara-Sahel, have limited knowledge on its biodiversity. However, over the last decade, there have been an increasing number of published scientific studies based on modern geomatic and molecular tools, and broad sampling of taxa of these regions. This review tracks trends in knowledge about biodiversity patterns, processes and threats across the Sahara-Sahel, and anticipates needs for biodiversity research and conservation. Recent studies are changing completely the perception of regional biodiversity patterns. Instead of relatively low species diversity with distribution covering most of the region, studies now suggest a high rate of endemism and larger number of species, with much narrower and fragmented ranges, frequently limited to micro-hotspots of biodiversity. Molecular-based studies are also unravelling cryptic diversity associated with mountains, which together with recent distribution atlases, allows identifying integrative biogeographic patterns in biodiversity distribution. Mapping of multivariate environmental variation (at 1kmx1km resolution) of the region illustrates main biogeographical features of the Sahara-Sahel and supports recently hypothesised dispersal corridors and refugia. Micro-scale water-features present mostly in mountains have been associated with local biodiversity hotspots. However, the distribution of available data on vertebrates highlights current knowledge gaps that still apply to a large proportion of the Sahara-Sahel. Current research is providing insights into key evolutionary and ecological processes, including causes and timing of radiation and divergence for multiple taxa, and associating the onset of the Sahara with diversification processes for low-mobility vertebrates. Examples of phylogeographic patterns are showing the importance of allopatric speciation in the Sahara-Sahel, and this review presents a synthetic overview of the most commonly hypothesised diversification mechanisms. Studies are also stressing that biodiversity is threatened by increasing human activities in the region, including overhunting and natural resources prospection, and in the future by predicted global warming. A representation of areas of conflict, landmines, and natural resources extraction illustrates how human activities and regional insecurity are hampering biodiversity research and conservation. Although there are still numerous knowledge gaps for the optimised conservation of biodiversity in the region, a set of research priorities is provided to identify the framework data needed to support regional conservation planning.;"Africa; biodiversity; climate change; conservation; deserts; distribution; diversification; phylogeography; Sahara; Sahel";"MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA SEQUENCES; JERBOAS DIPODIDAE JACULUS; ACINONYX-JUBATUS SCHREBER; HONEYBEES APIS-MELLIFERA; WEST-AFRICA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTH-AFRICA; NUCLEAR-DNA; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; MOROCCAN HERPETOFAUNA";Biology & Biochemistry;Biology;"[Brito, Jose C.; Godinho, Raquel; Martinez-Freiria, Fernando; Rebelo, Hugo; Santos, Xavier; Vale, Candida G.; Velo-Anton, Guillermo; Boratynski, Zbyszek; Carvalho, Silvia B.; Ferreira, Sonia; Goncalves, Duarte V.; Silva, Teresa L.; Tarroso, Pedro; Campos, Joao C.; Leite, Joao V.; Nogueira, Joana; Alvares, Francisco] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Brito, Jose C.; Vale, Candida G.; Ferreira, Sonia; Goncalves, Duarte V.; Silva, Teresa L.; Campos, Joao C.; Nogueira, Joana] Univ Porto, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, P-4169007 Oporto, Portugal; [Pleguezuelos, Juan M.] Univ Granada, Dept Biol Anim, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Rebelo, Hugo] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England; [Boratynski, Zbyszek] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Ctr Excellence Evolutionary Res, SF-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Sillero, Neftali] Univ Porto Porto, CICGE, P-4169007 Porto Porto, Portugal; [Sow, Andack S.; Fahd, Soumia] Univ Abdelmalek Essaadi, Dept Biol, Tetouan 93002, Morocco; [Crochet, Pierre-Andre] Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, EPHE UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Carranza, Salvador] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CSIC, Inst Evolutionary Biol, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain";Brito, JC (reprint author), Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.;"Finland; France; Morocco; Portugal; Spain; United Kingdom";"Finland; France; Morocco; Portugal; Spain; United Kingdom";"ESP; FIN; FRA; GBR; MAR; PRT";19;BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS;;;;;89;1;215;231;;10.1111/brv.12049;1464-7931;1469-185X;;1464-7931 eISSN: 1469-185X;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175;Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175;UMR5175;UMR5175;5 - Exceptionelle

Although well-known ecological patterns apply to most ponds in Europe and elsewhere, recent data highlight that part of the environmental variables governing pond biodiversity remain specific to climatic/biogeographic regions and to elevation ranges, suggesting that, in addition to common practice, management plans should include range-specific measures. Beyond the contribution of individual ponds to the aquatic and terrestrial life, connected networks of ponds are vital in the provision of new climate space as a response to global climate change, by allowing the observed northward and/or upward movements of species. In terms of services, ponds offer sustainable solutions to key issues of water management and climate change such as nutrient retention, rainfall interception, or carbon sequestration.

It is considered the worst plant pest in Hawaii and French Polynesia. This species has also invaded the rain forest of Australia, New Caledonia and Sri Lanka, where it is extremely difficult to eradicate. To assess the susceptibility to invasion by M. calvescens in new areas, we investigated the current and future suitable areas for this aggressive invader worldwide. We also assessed the protected areas currently at risk of invasion by considering botanic gardens as a proxy for likelihood of introduction, since most successful invasions by M. calvescens originated from private or public garden escapees. Our results predict that about 7.2 % of total landmass is currently suitable for M. calvescens, with 54.8 % outside the native range including 44.5 % within tropical forests in the southern hemisphere. We identified 91 countries, 400 islands, and up to 364 protected areas with suitable environments outside of M. calvescens native range. By the 2080s, worldwide land suitable for M. calvescens is predicted to be reduced by up to half due to climate change. This decrease is mainly predicted to occur in M. calvescens native ranges as well as in countries where the presence of the species has not yet been reported. In contrast, the invaded range is predicted to slightly decrease, showing an interesting example of a double negative effect of climate change on the distribution of an invader. Our work provides information for land managers and stakeholders that can help to avert the introduction and spread of M. calvescens in their territories. We also emphasize the importance of risk assessments on the living collections of botanic gardens, as a common source of escapees of invasive plants.;"Miconia calvescens; Climate change; Species distribution model; Botanic gardens; Protected areas";"SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; TROPICAL RAIN-FORESTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; PLANT INTRODUCTIONS; DC MELASTOMATACEAE; NATURE-RESERVES; UNITED-STATES; AUSTRALIA; NICHE";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";"[Gonzalez-Munoz, Noelia] Univ Alcala de Henares, Dept Ciencias Vida, Madrid, Spain; [Bellard, Celine; Leclerc, Camille; Courchamp, Franck] Univ Paris 11, UMR CNRS 8079, Ecol Systemat & Evolut, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Meyer, Jean-Yves] Minist Educ Enseignement Super & Rech, Delegat Rech, Gouvernement Polynesie Francaise, Papeete, Fr Polynesia";Gonzalez-Munoz, N (reprint author), Univ Alcala de Henares, Dept Ciencias Vida, Madrid, Spain.;"France; French Polynesia; Spain";"France; Spain";"ESP; FRA";0;BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS;;;;;17;11;3337;3350;;10.1007/s10530-015-0960-x;1387-3547;1573-1464;;1387-3547 eISSN: 1573-1464;;oui;1;2015;oui;1;2015;Ecologie, systématique et évolution (ESE), UMR8079;Ecologie, systématique et évolution (ESE), UMR8079;UMR8079;UMR8079;4 - Excellente

Erosion plots monitored over four years showed spatially contrasted results. Most of the soils produced from 0.015 to 2.5 t ha(-1) y(-1), whereas badlands produced 350 t ha(-1) y(-1). The average sediment yield measured at the outlet during the same period was approximately 4 t ha(-1) y(-1). The STREAM distributed erosion model was parameterized using these field measurements (infiltration rates and runoff sediment concentrations). The results showed an overall agreement between the modelled and measured annual cumulative sediment yields. Simulations of the ARPEGE meteorological model were used for the 1960-1990 and 2070-2100 periods. The changes between these two periods were downscaled using three different methods, decreasing annual precipitations by 10-14%, although with more rainfall in summer and fall. Climate change alone increased sediment yield by 4.7-10.1%. However, simulations showed that land use changes might potentially induce much larger changes in erosion (up to 250%), approximately proportional to the evolution of the extension of badlands.

From coastal to deep-sea ecosystems, ecologists are exploring new areas of research to find model organisms that help predict the future of life on our planet. Among the different categories of organisms, meiofauna offer several advantages for the study of marine benthic ecosystems. This paper reviews the advances in the study of meiofauna with regard to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Four taxonomic groups are valuable for predicting global changes: foraminifers (especially calcareous forms), nematodes, copepods and ostracods. Environmental variables are fundamental in the interpretation of meiofaunal patterns and multistressor experiments are more informative than single stressor ones, revealing complex ecological and biological interactions. Global change has a general negative effect on meiofauna, with important consequences on benthic food webs. However, some meiofaunal species can be favoured by the extreme conditions induced by global change, as they can exhibit remarkable physiological adaptations. This review highlights the need to incorporate studies on taxonomy, genetics and function of meiofaunal taxa into global change impact research.;"Meiofauna; Climate change; Anthropogenic impacts; Biomonitoring; Natural observations and experimental studies";"CLIPPERTON FRACTURE-ZONE; OXYGEN MINIMUM ZONE; GULF-OF-MEXICO; SEA BENTHIC FORAMINIFERA; NEMATODE-COPEPOD RATIO; CENTRAL INDIAN-OCEAN; SEAGRASS POSIDONIA-OCEANICA; MANGROVE RHIZOPHORA-MANGLE; SEWAGE-TREATMENT PLANTS; EASTERN TROPIC PACIFIC";"Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Biodiversity Conservation; Marine & Freshwater Biology";"[Zeppilli, Daniela; Sarrazin, Jozee] IFREMER, Ctr Brest, REM EEP LEP, Inst Carnot Ifremer EDROME, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Leduc, Daniel] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington 6021, New Zealand; [Arbizu, Pedro Martinez] DZMB, Senckenberg Meer, Wilhelmshaven, Germany; [Fontaneto, Diego] CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, I-28922 Verbania, Italy; [Fontanier, Christophe] IFREMER, Ctr Brest, REM GM LES, Inst Carnot Ifremer EDROME, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Gooday, Andrew J.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton S014 3ZH, Hants, England; [Kristensen, Reinhardt Mobjerg; Sorensen, Martin V.] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Ivanenko, Viatcheslav N.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Moscow, Russia; [Vanreusel, Ann] Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Sect, Dept Biol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Zeppilli, Daniela; Thebault, Julien; Allio, Noemie; Andro, Thomas; Arvigo, Alexandre; Castrec, Justine; Danielo, Morgan; Foulon, Valentin; Fumeron, Raphaelle; Hermabessiere, Ludovic; Hulot, Vivien; James, Tristan; Langonne-Augen, Roxanne; Le Bot, Tangi; Long, Marc; Mahabror, Dendy; Morel, Quentin; Pantalos, Michael; Pouplard, Etienne; Raimondeau, Laura; Rio-Cabello, Antoine; Seite, Sarah; Traisnel, Gwendoline; Urvoy, Kevin; Van der Stegen, Thomas; Weyand, Mariam] Univ Brest, Inst Univ Europeen Mer, Lab Sci Environm Marin CNRS IRD UBO UMR6539, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Mea, Marianna] SEAMap Srl, I-17052 Savona, Italy; [Fernandes, David] IFREMER, Ctr Brest, BLP, Inst Carnot Ifremer EDROME, F-29280 Plouzane, France";Zeppilli, D (reprint author), IFREMER, Ctr Brest, REM EEP LEP, Inst Carnot Ifremer EDROME, ZI Pointe Diable,CS10070, F-29280 Plouzane, France.;"Belgium; Denmark; France; Germany; Italy; New Zealand; Russia; United Kingdom";"Belgium; Denmark; France; Germany; Italy; New Zealand; Russia; United Kingdom";"BEL; DEU; DNK; FRA; GBR; ITA; NZL; RUS";1;MARINE BIODIVERSITY;;;;;45;3;505;535;;10.1007/s12526-015-0359-z;1867-1616;1867-1624;;1867-1616 eISSN: 1867-1624;;oui;1;2015;oui;1;2015;Laboratoire des sciences de l'environnement marin (LEMAR), UMR6539;Laboratoire des sciences de l'environnement marin (LEMAR), UMR6539;UMR6539;UMR6539;3 - Correcte

In this study, we propose to use metacommunity theory as a conceptual framework to better understand how river network structure influences the spatial organization of aquatic communities in glacierized catchments. At 51 stream sites in an Andean glacierized catchment (Ecuador), we sampled benthic macroinvertebrates, measured physico-chemical and food resource conditions, and calculated geographical, altitudinal and glaciality distances among all sites. Using partial redundancy analysis, we partitioned community variation to evaluate the relative strength of environmental conditions (e.g., glaciality, food resource) vs. spatial processes (e.g., overland, watercourse, and downstream directional dispersal) in organizing the aquatic metacommunity. Results revealed that both environmental and spatial variables significantly explained community variation among sites. Among all environmental variables, the glacial influence component best explained community variation. Overland spatial variables based on geographical and altitudinal distances significantly affected community variation. Watercourse spatial variables based on glaciality distances had a unique significant effect on community variation. Within alpine catchment, glacial meltwater affects macroinvertebrate metacommunity structure in many ways. Indeed, the harsh environmental conditions characterizing glacial influence not only constitute the primary environmental filter but also, limit water-borne macroinvertebrate dispersal. Therefore, glacier runoff acts as an aquatic dispersal barrier, isolating species in headwater streams, and preventing non-adapted species to colonize throughout the entire stream network. Under a scenario of glacier runoff decrease, we expect a reduction in both environmental filtering and dispersal limitation, inducing a taxonomic homogenization of the aquatic fauna in glacierized catchments as well as the extinction of specialized species in headwater groundwater and glacier-fed streams, and consequently an irreversible reduction in regional diversity.;;"MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DISPERSAL LIMITATION; RIVER SYSTEMS; LONGITUDINAL DISTRIBUTION; ENVIRONMENTAL-CONDITIONS; SHRINKING GLACIERS; HEADWATER STREAMS; SPATIAL PROCESSES; AQUATIC INSECTS; TROPICAL ANDES";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Cauvy-Fraunie, Sophie; Dangles, Olivier] IRD 247 CNRS UP Sud 9191, UMR EGCE, IRD, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Cauvy-Fraunie, Sophie; Espinosa, Rodrigo; Andino, Patricio; Jacobsen, Dean; Dangles, Olivier] Pontificia Univ Catolica Ecuador, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Quito, Ecuador; [Cauvy-Fraunie, Sophie; Dangles, Olivier] Univ Mayor San Andres, Inst Ecol, La Paz, Bolivia; [Jacobsen, Dean] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Freshwater Biol Lab, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark";Cauvy-Fraunie, S (reprint author), IRD 247 CNRS UP Sud 9191, UMR EGCE, IRD, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.;"Bolivia; Denmark; Ecuador; France";"Bolivia; Denmark; Ecuador; France";"BOL; DNK; ECU; FRA";0;PLOS ONE;;;;;10;8;;;e0136793;10.1371/journal.pone.0136793;1932-6203;;;1932-6203;;oui;1;2015;oui;1;2015;Evolution, génomes, comportement et écologie (EGCE), UMR9191;Evolution, génomes, comportement et écologie (EGCE), UMR9191;UMR9191;UMR9191;4 - Excellente

The results show that the seasonal cycle of river discharge is generally modeled well in the low and middle latitudes but not in the high latitudes, where the peak discharge (due to snow and ice melting) is underestimated. For the annual mean discharge, the DGVMs chained with the routing model show an underestimation. Furthermore, the 30year trend of discharge is also underestimated. For the interannual variability of discharge, a skill score based on overlapping of probability density functions (PDFs) suggests that most models correctly reproduce the observed variability (correlation coefficient higher than 0.5; i.e., models account for 50% of observed interannual variability) except for the Lena, Yenisei, Yukon, and the Congo river basins. In addition, we compared the simulated runoff from different simulations where models were forced with either fixed or varying land use. This suggests that both seasonal and annual mean runoff has been little affected by land use change but that the trend itself of runoff is sensitive to land use change. None of the models when considered individually show significantly better performances than any other and in all basins. This suggests that based on current modeling capability, a regional-weighted average of multimodel ensemble projections might be appropriate to reduce the bias in future projection of global river discharge.";"river discharge; model evaluation; land use change; climate change impacts";"LAND-SURFACE MODEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER DISCHARGE; WATER AVAILABILITY; PLANT GEOGRAPHY; CARBON-DIOXIDE; RUNOFF; HYDROLOGY; CO2; PRECIPITATION";Geosciences;Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences;"[Yang, Hui; Piao, Shilong; Zeng, Zhenzhong; Ciais, Philippe; Huang, Mengtian; Li, Yue; Li, Xiran] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong; Wang, Lei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ciais, Philippe; Yin, Yi; Guimberteau, Matthieu; Peylin, Philippe; Viovy, Nicolas] CEA, CNRS, UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Friedlingstein, Pierre; Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Comp & Math, Exeter, Devon, England; [Ahlstrom, Anders] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Sch Earth Energy & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ahlstrom, Anders] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Huntingford, Chris] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Levis, Sam] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Levis, Sam] Climate Corp, San Francisco, CA USA; [Levy, Peter E.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Penicuik, Midlothian, Scotland; [Lomas, Mark R.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Poulter, Ben] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Zaehle, Soenke] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Zeng, Ning; Zhao, Fang] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA";Piao, SL (reprint author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;"France; Germany; People's Republic of China; Sweden; United Kingdom; United States";"France; Germany; People's Republic of China; Sweden; United Kingdom; United States";"CHN; DEU; FRA; GBR; SWE; USA";0;JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES;;;;;120;15;7488;7505;;10.1002/2015JD023129;2169-897X;2169-8996;;2169-897X eISSN: 2169-8996;;oui;1;2015;oui;1;2015;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;UMR8212;UMR8212;0 - Sans notoriété
WOS:000357223900006;;Spatial coherence and change of opposite white spruce temperature sensitivities on floodplains in Alaska confirms early-stage boreal biome shift;2015;"Juday, GP; Alix, C; Grant, TA";"Juday, Glenn P.; Alix, Claire; Grant, Thomas A., III";FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT Volume: 350 Pages: 46-61 Published: 2015;English;Article;Since the mid 1970s, Interior Alaska white spruce trees experienced markedly lower growth than during the 19th and early 20th centuries. This observation raises the question of forest persistence on certain sites of lowland central and eastern Alaska. We analyzed white spruce growth across a 36-site network (540 trees) on three major river floodplains in boreal Alaska along a longitudinal gradient from eastern Interior to the southwest tree limit to test for the presence of tree growth patterns and climate sensitivities. Chronologies are compared for temperature sensitivity at both stand and individual tree levels, using data from Bethel, McGrath, and Fairbanks NWS stations during the common period of 1952 2001. Cross-dated stand-level ring width chronologies indicate three regions of common signal in tree growth across the gradient. Temperature sensitivity of stand- and individual-tree chronologies is spatially coherent. Most downriver chronologies correlate positively with spring mean monthly temperatures (MMT) at Bethel, mid- and upriver chronologies correlate negatively with MMT of May and previous year July at either McGrath or Fairbanks, and an area in between is a mixed population of positive and negative responders. In downriver positive responders, recent increases from suboptimal cool temperatures accelerated tree growth, while in mid- and upriver negative responders, recent increases from optimal or above-optimal temperatures decreased growth. Fairbanks negative responders are also negatively correlated with a 200-yr index of recorded and reconstructed Fairbanks summer temperatures, and recent sustained record high summer temperatures are associated with the lowest relative growth. Until the 1940s, absolute growth rate of negative responders was greater than positive responders, but from the 1970s the positive responders grew more. These results explain why northern ring width samples can display opposite temperature sensitivity and contribute to understanding recent divergence or loss of temperature sensitivity in a changing climate. We find that July MMT and annual precipitation at Fairbanks are now outside the limits that previously characterized the North American distribution of white spruce, and are near the reported physiological limits of the species. Our results of the spatial and temporal change of white spruce temperature sensitivity provide strong empirical evidence of previously proposed early stage biome shift in boreal Alaska due to clear climatic causes. Already, western Alaska, previously extending to tree limit, has become the optimum climate region for the species. With modest additional warming widespread tree death will be unavoidable on warmer lowland interior sites, where persistence of white spruce is unlikely. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The main goal of this study consisted in a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the impact of the 20 % increase in rainfall intensity that led, in the summer of 2013, to overflows in the Rolland-Therrien combined sewer system in the city of Longueuil, Canada. The PCSWMM 2013 model was used to assess the sensitivity of this overflow under current (2013) and future (2050) climate conditions. The simulated quantitative variables (peak flow, Q(CSO), and volume discharged, VD) served as the basis for deriving ecotoxicological risk indices and event fluxes (EFs) transported to the St. Lawrence (SL) River. Results highlighted 15 to 500 % increases in VD and 13 to 148 % increases in Q(CSO) by 2050 (compared to 2013), based on eight rainfall events measured from May to October. These results show that (i) the relationships between precipitation and combined sewer overflow variables are not linear and (ii) the design criteria for current hydraulic infrastructure must be revised to account for the impact of climate change (CC) arising from changes in precipitation regimes. EFs discharged into the SL River will be 2.24 times larger in the future than they are now (2013) due to large VDs resulting from CC. This will, in turn, lead to excessive inputs of total suspended solids (TSSs) and tracers for numerous urban pollutants (organic matter and nutrients, metals) into the receiving water body. Ecotoxicological risk indices will increase by more than 100 % by 2050 compared to 2013.

Recent observations encompass too limited a range of climate variability to provide a robust test of the ability to simulate climate changes. Past climate changes provide a unique opportunity for out-of-sample evaluation of model performance. Palaeo-evaluation has shown that the large-scale changes seen in twenty-first-century projections, including enhanced land-sea temperature contrast, latitudinal amplification, changes in temperature seasonality and scaling of precipitation with temperature, are likely to be realistic. Although models generally simulate changes in large-scale circulation sufficiently well to shift regional climates in the right direction, they often do not predict the correct magnitude of these changes. Differences in performance are only weakly related to modern-day biases or climate sensitivity, and more sophisticated models are not better at simulating climate changes.

Ragweed plants could further invade European land with climate and land-use changes(2,3). However, airborne pollen evolution depends not only on plant invasion, but also on pollen production, release and atmospheric dispersion changes. To predict the effect of climate and land-use changes on airborne pollen concentrations, we used two comprehensive modelling frameworks accounting for all these factors under high-end and moderate climate and land-use change scenarios. We estimate that by 2050 airborne ragweed pollen concentrations will be about 4 times higher than they are now, with a range of uncertainty from 2 to 12 largely depending on the seed dispersal rate assumptions. About a third of the airborne pollen increase is due to on-going seed dispersal, irrespective of climate change. The remaining two-thirds are related to climate and land-use changes that will extend ragweed habitat suitability in northern and eastern Europe and increase pollen production in established ragweed areas owing to increasing CO2. Therefore, climate change and ragweed seed dispersal in current and future suitable areas will increase airborne pollen concentrations, which may consequently heighten the incidence and prevalence of ragweed allergy.;;"AMBROSIA-ARTEMISIIFOLIA; COMMON RAGWEED; SPREAD; MODEL; CO2; HABITAT; FRANCE";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Hamaoui-Laguel, Lynda; Vautard, Robert; Viovy, Nicolas; Schaffhauser, Alice] CEA CNRS UVSQ, IPSL, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, UMR8212, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Hamaoui-Laguel, Lynda; Colette, Augustin] Inst Natl Environm Ind & Risques, F-60550 Verneuil En Halatte, France; [Liu, Li; Solmon, Fabien] Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Earth Syst Phys Sect, I-34100 Trieste, Italy; [Khvorostyanov, Dmitry] CNRS, IPSL, Lab Meteorol Dynam, UMR8539, F-91120 Palaiseau, France; [Essl, Franz] Univ Vienna, Fac Ctr Biodivers, Div Conservat Biol Vegetat & Landscape Ecol, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Chuine, Isabelle] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CEFE UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 05, France; [Semenov, Mikhail A.; Storkey, Jonathan] Rothamsted Res, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; [Thibaudon, Michel] Reseau Natl Surveillance Aerobiol, F-69690 Brussieu, France; [Epstein, Michelle M.] Med Univ Vienna, Expt Allergy, Div Immunol Allergy & Infect Dis, Dept Dermatol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria";Hamaoui-Laguel, L (reprint author), CEA CNRS UVSQ, IPSL, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, UMR8212, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.;"Austria; France; Italy; United Kingdom";"Austria; France; Italy; United Kingdom";"AUT; FRA; GBR; ITA";0;NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE;;;;;5;8;766;U186;;10.1038/NCLIMATE2652;1758-678X;1758-6798;;1758-678X eISSN: 1758-6798;;oui;1;2015;oui;1;2015;"Chimie bio-inspirée et innovations écologiques, FRE3673; Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire de météorologie dynamique (LMD), UMR8539; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"Chimie bio-inspirée et innovations écologiques, FRE3673; Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire de météorologie dynamique (LMD), UMR8539; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"FR636; FRE3673; UMR8212; UMR8539";"FR636; FRE3673; UMR8212; UMR8539";5 - Exceptionelle

We used the Golo River system, Corsica, France, as a natural laboratory to investigate the impact of Late Quaternary climate and sea level oscillations on sediment flux from a catchment and on fluvio-deltaic stratigraphy. We applied a numerical model, PaCMod, which calculates catchment sediment production and transport and compared modeling output to the sedimentary record of the Golo alluvial-coastal plain, whose chronology was reinterpreted using new optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages on feldspars. Our modeling, OSL ages, and geomorphological results indicate that the two main phases of braidplain development in the Golo alluvial-coastal plain occurred during the cold dry phases of MIS5 and during the late MIS4-early MIS3, as a consequence of high catchment erosion rates and low water discharge. Incision and sediment reworking occurred during sea level low stand periods (MIS4 and late MIS3-MIS2). High sediment flux pulses from the catchment outlet were generated during the Lateglacial and early Holocene, as a result of the release of sediments previously stored within the catchment and enhanced snowmelt. Our results suggest a non-linear response of the Golo River system to climatic and eustatic changes, caused by sediment storage within the catchment and geomorphological thresholds. This indicates that a direct comparison between palaeo-climate and stratigraphy is not possible without considering catchment sediment storage and sediment transport delays out of the catchment.

The overall objective of this study is to investigate known challenges related to buildings LCA such as biogenic carbon accounting and dynamic and prospective aspects, and to discuss how they affect LCA results for low energy buildings and what developments are still needed. Three single family houses built respectively with timber frame, concrete blocks cavity wall, and cast concrete are used as a case study, focusing on the global warming impact category. When biogenic carbon is addressed, the timber house is the less impacting choice, whether it is landfilled or burned at the end-of-life. The cavity wall house is the second most favourable option, and the cast concrete house is the worst one. In the case of landfilling for the timber house, the biogenic carbon balance is not neutral and worth to be considered. When a dynamic approach and specific prospective scenarios are considered, the ranking between houses stays the same, but the gaps between options vary e.g. the gap between the landfilled timber house and the cast concrete house vary from 40 % to 60 % when optimistic changes in the electricity mix are considered. Dynamic LCA allows for a more consistent analysis of emissions flows and global warming impacts over time. Prospective LCA could provide more relevant LCA results but increases uncertainty and could be used as sensitivity analysis for long life span buildings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While the vitality of the meadow is satisfactory overall, due to the low impact of human pressure along these coasts, patterns of change over time show a slight degradation of the main descriptors of the meadow. The meadow's vitality index had declined on average by 8.6%, the BiPo index by 9.8%, and there was a regression of the lower limit at six sites. While this pattern of change may reflect local alterations in the environment (increase or decline in human pressure), the regressive dynamic of the meadow observed at the lower limit at several reference sites (e.g., Marine Protected Areas, sites distant from sources of human impact) is more worrying. Two hypotheses might explain the regression observed: (i) the rise in mean sea level during the study period, which may have resulted in a significant regression in sectors where the slope is relatively slight, and (ii) the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which declined from 2002 to reach very low values in 2010.

Trends of SOC stock changes after agroecosystem establishment vary according to the spatial scale considered, and factors explaining these trends may differ sometimes according to meta-analyses. We have reviewed the knowledge about changes in SOC stocks in Amazonia after the establishment of pasture or cropland, sought relationships between observed changes and soil, climatic variables and management practices, and synthesized the C-13 measured in pastures. Our dataset consisted of 21 studies mostly synchronic, across 52 sites (Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Suriname), totalling 70 forest-agroecosystem comparisons. We found that pastures (n=52, mean age = 17.6years) had slightly higher SOC stocks than forest (+6.8 +/- 3.1%), whereas croplands (n=18, mean age = 8.7years) had lower SOC stocks than forest (-8.5 +/- 2.9%). Annual precipitation and SOC stocks under forest had no effect on the SOC changes in the agroecosystems. For croplands, we found a lower SOC loss than other meta-analyses, but the short time period after deforestation here could have reduced this loss. There was no clear effect of tillage on the SOC response. Management of pastures, whether they were degraded/nominal/improved, had no significant effect on SOC response. C-13 measurements on 16 pasture chronosequences showed that decay of forest-derived SOC was variable, whereas pasture-derived SOC was less so and was characterized by an accumulation plateau of 20 Mg SOC ha(-1) after 20years. The large uncertainties in SOC response observed could be derived from the chronosequence approach, sensitive to natural soil variability and to human management practices. This study emphasizes the need for diachronic and long-term studies, associated with better knowledge of agroecosystem management.;"annual crop; carbon storage; chronosequence; deforestation; grassland; humid tropics; rainforest; soil organic matter; soil tillage; delta C-13";"LAND-USE CHANGE; SLASH-AND-BURN; BRAZILIAN AMAZON; EASTERN AMAZONIA; MATTER DYNAMICS; RAIN-FOREST; SIZE-FRACTIONS; TROPICAL SOILS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEFORESTATION";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Fujisaki, Kenji; Perrin, Anne-Sophie] Ctr Tech Interprofessionnel Oleagineux & Chanvre, EPLEFPA Guyane, F-97355 Macouria, Guyane Francais, France; [Fujisaki, Kenji; Bernoux, Martial; Brossard, Michel] IRD, UMR Eco & Sols 210, F-34060 Montpellier 02, France; [Desjardins, Thierry] IRD, UMR iEES Paris 242, F-93143 Bondy, France; [Balbino, Luiz Carlos] EMBRAPA Cerrados, BR-73310970 Planaltina, DF, Brazil";Brossard, M (reprint author), IRD, UMR Eco & Sols 210, Campus SupAgro,Bat 12,2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 02, France.;"Brazil; France";"Brazil; France";"BRA; FRA";0;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;21;7;2773;2786;;10.1111/gcb.12906;1354-1013;1365-2486;;1354-1013 eISSN: 1365-2486;;oui;1;2015;oui;1;2015;Institut d'écologie et des sciences de l'environnement de Paris (IEES), UMR7618;Institut d'écologie et des sciences de l'environnement de Paris (IEES), UMR7618;UMR7618;UMR7618;5 - Exceptionelle

Although climate change mitigation has been identified as an important strategy for biodiversity conservation, bioenergy remains a controversial mitigation action due to its potential negative ecological and socio-economic impacts which arise through habitat modification by land use change. While the debate continues, the separate or simultaneous impacts of both climate change and bioenergy on biodiversity have not yet been compared. We assess projected range shifts of 156 European bird species by 2050 under two alternative climate change trajectories: a baseline scenario, where the global mean temperature increases by 4 degrees C by the end of the century, and a 2 degrees scenario, where global concerted effort limits the temperature increase to below 2 degrees C. For the latter scenario, we also quantify the pressure exerted by increased cultivation of energy biomass as modelled by IMAGE2.4, an integrated land use model. The global bioenergy use in this scenario is in the lower end of the range of previously estimated sustainable potential. Under the assumptions of these scenarios, we find that the magnitude of range shifts due to climate change is far greater than the impact of land conversion to woody bioenergy plantations within the European Union, and that mitigation of climate change reduces the exposure experienced by species. However, we identified potential for local conservation conflict between priority areas for conservation and bioenergy production. These conflicts must be addressed by strict bioenergy sustainability criteria that acknowledge biodiversity conservation needs beyond existing protected areas and apply also to biomass imported from outside the European Union.;"biodiversity; climate change adaptation; climate change mitigation; complementarity; renewable energy; spatial conservation prioritization";"BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; EXTINCTION RISK; BREEDING BIRDS; MANAGEMENT; FUTURE; SCENARIOS; ADAPTATION; OPTIONS; AREAS; MODEL";"Agricultural Sciences; Biology & Biochemistry; Engineering; Geosciences";"Agronomy; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Energy & Fuels";"[Meller, Laura; Cabeza, Mar] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Metapopulat Res Grp, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Meller, Laura; Thuiller, Wilfried; Pironon, Samuel] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine UMR CNRS 5553, F-938041 Grenoble 9, France; [Pironon, Samuel] Inst Pirenaico Ecol CSIC, Zaragoza 50080, Spain; [Barbet-Massin, Morgane] UPMC, Ctr Rech Biol Populat Oiseaux, CNRS, Museum Natl Hist Nat,UMR MNHN 7204, F-75005 Paris, France; [Barbet-Massin, Morgane] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Hof, Andries] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, Bilthoven, Netherlands";Meller, L (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Metapopulat Res Grp, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.;"Finland; France; Netherlands; Spain; United States";"Finland; France; Netherlands; Spain; United States";"ESP; FIN; FRA; NLD; USA";1;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY;;;;;7;4;741;751;;10.1111/gcbb.12178;1757-1693;1757-1707;;1757-1693 eISSN: 1757-1707;;oui;1;2015;oui;1;2015;"Centre des Sciences de la Conservation (CESCO), UMR7204; Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553";"Centre des Sciences de la Conservation (CESCO), UMR7204; Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553";"UMR5553; UMR7204";"UMR5553; UMR7204";5 - Exceptionelle

Under the assumption that most winter excess mortality is due to cold temperature, many previous studies have concluded that winter mortality will substantially decline in a warming climate. Weanalyzed whether and to what extent cold temperatures are associated with excess winter mortality across multiple cities and over multiple years within individual cities, using daily temperature and mortality data from 36 US cities (1985-2006) and 3 French cities (1971-2007). Comparing across cities, we found that excess winter mortality did not depend on seasonal temperature range, and was no lower in warmer vs. colder cities, suggesting that temperature is not a key driver of winter excess mortality. Using regression models within monthly strata, we found that variability in daily mortality within cities was not strongly influenced by winter temperature. Finally we found that inadequate control for seasonality in analyses of the effects of cold temperatures led to spuriously large assumed cold effects, and erroneous attribution of winter mortality to cold temperatures. Our findings suggest that reductions in cold-related mortality under warming climate may be much smaller than some have assumed. This should be of interest to researchers and policy makers concerned with projecting future health effects of climate change and developing relevant adaptation strategies.;"warming temperature; health; winter";"ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ISCHEMIC-HEART-DISEASE; COLD WEATHER; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; CARDIAC MORTALITY; UNITED-STATES; RISK-FACTORS; CITIES; INFLUENZA";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Kinney, Patrick L.] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Schwartz, Joel] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pascal, Mathilde; Le Tertre, Alain; Medina, Sylvia] Inst Veille Sanit, F-94415 St Maurice, France; [Petkova, Elisaveta] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Natl Ctr Disaster Preparedness, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Vautard, Robert] Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France";Kinney, PL (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10032 USA.;"France; United States";"France; United States";"FRA; USA";0;ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS;;;;;10;6;;;064016;10.1088/1748-9326/10/6/064016;1748-9326;;;1748-9326;;oui;1;2015;oui;1;2015;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;UMR8212;UMR8212;4 - Excellente

We estimated the effects of these changes on biological communities using a coupled biogeochemical (PISCES) - ecosystems (APECOSM) model forced by the physical outputs of the last generation of the IPSL-CM Earth System Model. The APECOSM model is a size-structured bio-energetic model that simulates the 3D dynamical distributions of three interactive pelagic communities (epipelagic, mesopelagic, and migratory) under the effects of multiple environmental factors. The PISCES-APECOSM model ran from 1850 to 2100 under historical forcing followed by RCP8.5. Our RCP8.5 simulation highlights significant changes in the spatial distribution, biomass, and maximum body-size of the simulated pelagic communities. Biomass and maximum body-size increase at high latitude over the course of the century, reflecting the capacity of marine organisms to respond to new suitable environment. At low- and midlatitude, biomass and maximum body-size strongly decrease. In those regions, large organisms cannot maintain their high metabolic needs because of limited and declining food availability. This resource reduction enhances the competition and modifies the biomass distribution among and within the three communities: the proportion of small organisms increases in the three communities and the migrant community that initially comprised a higher proportion of small organisms is favored. The greater resilience of small body-size organisms resides in their capacity to fulfill their metabolic needs under reduced energy supply and is further favored by the release of predation pressure due to the decline of large organisms. These results suggest that small body-size organisms might be more resilient to climate change than large ones.;"biogeochemical model; body-size of organisms; climate change; climate scenario; high trophic level model; pelagic communities; trophic transfer";"STRUCTURED ENERGY-FLOW; VERTICAL MIGRATION; FISH PRODUCTION; OCEAN; ECOSYSTEMS; IMPACTS; MODEL; ZOOPLANKTON; SCENARIOS; ABUNDANCE";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Lefort, Stelly; Bopp, Laurent; Gehlen, Marion] CEA, LSCE, IPSL CNRS, UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Aumont, Olivier] IRD, LPO, UMR6539, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Arsouze, Thomas] ENSTA ParisTech, F-91762 Palaiseau, France; [Arsouze, Thomas] Ecole Polytech, LMD X, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Maury, Olivier] CRH, IRD, UMR EME 212, F-34203 Sete, France; [Maury, Olivier] Univ Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, Int Lab ICEMASA, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa";Lefort, S (reprint author), CEA, LSCE, IPSL CNRS, UVSQ, Point Courrier 132,Bat 712, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.;"France; South Africa";"France; South Africa";"FRA; ZAF";0;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;21;1;154;164;;10.1111/gcb.12679;1354-1013;1365-2486;;1354-1013 eISSN: 1365-2486;;oui;1;2015;oui;1;2015;"Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire de météorologie dynamique (LMD), UMR8539; Laboratoire des sciences de l'environnement marin (LEMAR), UMR6539; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire de météorologie dynamique (LMD), UMR8539; Laboratoire des sciences de l'environnement marin (LEMAR), UMR6539; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"FR636; UMR6539; UMR8212; UMR8539";"FR636; UMR6539; UMR8212; UMR8539";5 - Exceptionelle

However, here it is shown that when forced by SST alone, most state-of-the-art climate models do not reproduce a statistically significant upward trend in Sahelian precipitation over the last 30 years and that those models with a significant upward trend in rainfall seem to achieve this result for disparate reasons. Here the role of the Saharan heat low (SHL) in the recovery from the Sahelian drought of the 1980s is examined. Using observations and reanalyses, it is demonstrated that there has been an upward trend in SHL temperature that is coincident with the drought recovery. A heat and moisture budget analysis of the SHL suggests that the rise in temperature is due to greenhouse warming by water vapor, but that changes in water vapor are strongly dependent upon the temperature of the SHL: a process termed the Saharan water vapor-temperature (SWAT) feedback. It is shown that the structure of the drought recovery is consistent with a warming SHL and is evidence of a fundamental, but not exclusive, role for the SHL in the recent increase in Sahelian monsoon rainfall.;;"WEST-AFRICAN MONSOON; HEAT LOW; INTRASEASONAL VARIABILITY; RAINFALL VARIABILITY; EQUATORIAL ATLANTIC; IMPACT; DUST; DYNAMICS; SUMMER; CMIP5";Geosciences;Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences;"[Evan, Amato T.; Flamant, Cyrille; Kocha, Cecile] CNRS, Lab Atmosphere, Paris, France; [Evan, Amato T.; Flamant, Cyrille; Kocha, Cecile] Univ Paris 06, Paris, France; [Evan, Amato T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Lavaysse, Christophe] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Saci, Azzedine] Off Natl Meteorol, Algiers, Dar El Beida, Algeria";Evan, AT (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 8622 Kennel Way, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.;"Algeria; France; United States";"Algeria; France; United States";"DZA; FRA; USA";3;JOURNAL OF CLIMATE;;;;;28;1;108;123;;10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00039.1;0894-8755;1520-0442;;0894-8755 eISSN: 1520-0442;;oui;1;2015;oui;1;2015;Laboratoire Atmosphères, Milieux, Observations Spatiales (LATMOS), UMR8190;Laboratoire Atmosphères, Milieux, Observations Spatiales (LATMOS), UMR8190;UMR8190;UMR8190;4 - Excellente

Climate change impact on soil microbial communities and soil enzymatic activities can therefore strongly affect SOM turnover, and thereby determine the fate of ecosystems and their role as carbon sinks or sources. To simulate projected impacts of climate change on Swiss Jura subalpine grassland soils, an altitudinal soil transplantation experiment was set up in October 2009. On the fourth year of this experiment, we measured microbial biomass (MB), microbial community structure (MCS), and soil extracellular enzymatic activities (EEA) of nine hydrolytic and oxidative extracellular enzymes in the transplanted soils on a seasonal basis. We found a strong sampling date effect and a smaller but significant effect of the climate manipulation (soil transplantation) on EEA. Overall EEA was higher in winter and spring but enzymes linked to N and P cycles showed higher potential activities in autumn, suggesting that other factors than soil microclimate controlled their pool size, such as substrate availability. The climate warming manipulation decreased EEA in most cases, with oxidative enzymes more concerned than hydrolytic enzymes. In contrast to EEA, soil MB was more affected by the climate manipulation than by the seasons. Transplanting soils to lower altitudes caused a significant decrease in soil MB, but did not affect soil MCS. Conversely, a clear shift in soil MCS was observed between winter and summer. Mass-specific soil EEA (EEA normalized by MB) showed a systematic seasonal trend, with a higher ratio in winter than in summer, suggesting that the seasonal shift in MCS is accompanied by a change in their activities. Surprisingly, we observed a significant decrease in soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration after four years of soil transplantation, as compared to the control site, which could not be linked to any microbial data. We conclude that medium term (four years) warming and decreased precipitation strongly affected MB and EEA but not MCS in subalpine grassland soils, and that those shifts cannot be readily linked to the dynamics of soil carbon concentration under climate change.

Ice cores show that Antarctica cooled during the warm phases of the Greenland Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle and vice versa''', suggesting an interhemispheric redistribution of heat through a mechanism called the bipolar seesaw(4-6). Variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength are thought to have been important, but much uncertainty remains regarding the dynamics and trigger of these abrupt events'. Key information is contained in the relative phasing of hemispheric climate variations, yet the large, poorly constrained difference between gas age and ice age and the relatively low resolution of methane records from Antarctic ice cores have so far precluded methane-based synchronization at the required sub-centennial precision''''. Here we use a recently drilled high-accumulation Antarctic ice core to show that, on average, abrupt Greenland warming leads the corresponding Antarctic cooling onset by 218 +/- 92 years (2 sigma a) for DansgaardOeschger events, including the Bolling event; Greenland cooling leads the corresponding onset of Antarctic warming by 208 +/- 96 years. Our results demonstrate a north-to-south directionality of the abrupt climatic signal, which is propagated to the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes by oceanic rather than atmospheric processes. The similar interpolar phasing of warming and cooling transitions suggests that the transfer time of the climatic signal is independent of the AMOC background state.

However, also biotic interactions might indirectly affect the reproduction and recruitment success of plants in the context of climate change. Information about the interactive effects of changes in abiotic and biotic factors is essential, but still largely lacking, to better understand the potential effects of a changing climate on plant populations. Here we analyze the regeneration from seeds of Acer platanoides and Acer pseudoplatanus, two currently secondary forest tree species from seven regions along a 2200 km-wide latitudinal gradient in Europe. We assessed the germination, seedling survival and growth during two years in a common garden experiment where temperature, precipitation and competition with the understory vegetation were manipulated. A. platanoides was more sensitive to changes in biotic conditions while A. pseudoplatanus was affected by both abiotic and biotic changes. In general, competition reduced (in A. platanoides) and warming enhanced (in A. pseudoplatanus) germination and survival, respectively. Reduced competition strongly increased the growth of A. platanoides seedlings. Seedling responses were independent of the conditions experienced by the mother tree during seed production and maturation. Our results indicate that, due to the negative effects of competition on the regeneration of A. platanoides, it is likely that under stronger competition (projected under future climatic conditions) this species will be negatively affected in terms of germination, survival and seedling biomass. Climate-change experiments including both abiotic and biotic factors constitute a key step forward to better understand the response of tree species' regeneration to climate change.

The smallest areas (<1% area of the SO) are affected by glacier retreat and warming in the deeper euphotic layer. In the future, decrease in the sea-ice is expected to be widespread. Changes in iceberg impact resulting from further collapse of ice-shelves can potentially affect large parts of shelf and ephemerally in the off-shore regions. However, aragonite undersaturation (acidification) might become one of the biggest problems for the Antarctic marine ecosystem by affecting almost the entire SO. Direct and indirect impacts of various environmental changes to the three major habitats, sea-ice, pelagic and benthos and their biota are complex. The areas affected by environmental stressors range from 33% of the SO for a single stressor, 11% for two and 2% for three, to <1% for four and five overlapping factors. In the future, areas expected to be affected by 2 and 3 overlapping factors are equally large, including potential iceberg changes, and together cover almost 86% of the SO ecosystem.";"acidification; habitats; icebergs; ice-shelves; ozone depletion; sea-ice; warming";"WEST ANTARCTIC PENINSULA; ICE-SHELF COLLAPSE; UV-B RADIATION; ULTRAVIOLET-RADIATION; ROSS SEA; PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOM; IRON FERTILIZATION; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; MCMURDO SOUND; WEDDELL SEA";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Gutt, Julian; Buschmann, Alexander] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Bertler, Nancy] Victoria Univ Wellington, Joint Antarctic Res Inst, Wellington, New Zealand; [Bertler, Nancy] GNS Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Bracegirdle, Thomas J.; Xavier, Jose C.] British Antarctic Survey, Nat Environm Res Council, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Comiso, Josefino] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Cryospher Sci Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Hosie, Graham] Scott Polar Res Inst, SCAR Life Sci, Cambridge CB2 1ER, England; [Isla, Enrique] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Schloss, Irene R.] Inst Antartico Argentino, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Schloss, Irene R.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Schloss, Irene R.] Argentina, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Schloss, Irene R.] Inst Sci Rimouski, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Smith, Craig R.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tournadre, Jean] IFREMER, Lab Oceanog Spatiale, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Xavier, Jose C.] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, Inst Marine Res, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal";Gutt, J (reprint author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Alten Hafen 26, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany.;"Argentina; Canada; France; Germany; New Zealand; Portugal; Spain; United Kingdom; United States";"Argentina; Canada; France; Germany; New Zealand; Portugal; Spain; United Kingdom; United States";"ARG; CAN; DEU; ESP; FRA; GBR; NZL; PRT; USA";0;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;21;4;1434;1453;;10.1111/gcb.12794;1354-1013;1365-2486;;1354-1013 eISSN: 1365-2486;;oui;1;2015;oui;1;2015;Laboratoire d'études en Géophysique et océanographie spatiales (LEGOS), UMR5566;Laboratoire d'études en Géophysique et océanographie spatiales (LEGOS), UMR5566;UMR5566;UMR5566;5 - Exceptionelle

This process has a profound influence on what form of mineral-N is absorbed, used by plants, and retained in the soil, or lost to the environment, which in turn affects N-cycling, N-use efficiency (NUE) and ecosystem health and services. As reactive-N is often the most limiting in natural ecosystems, plants have acquired a range of mechanisms that suppress soil-nitrifier activity to limit N-losses via N-leaching and denitrification. Plants' ability to produce and release nitrification inhibitors from roots and suppress soil-nitrifier activity is termed 'biological nitrification inhibition' (BNI). With recent developments in methodology for in-situ measurement of nitrification inhibition, it is now possible to characterize BNI function in plants. This review assesses the current status of our understanding of the production and release of biological nitrification inhibitors (BNIs) and their potential in improving NUE in agriculture. A suite of genetic, soil and environmental factors regulate BNI activity in plants. BNI-function can be genetically exploited to improve the BNI-capacity of major food- and feed-crops to develop next-generation production systems with reduced nitrification and N2O emission rates to benefit both agriculture and the environment. The feasibility of such an approach is discussed based on the progresses made. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Most of these studies deal with the impact of experimental warming during summer when prevalent abiotic conditions are favorable to decomposition. Here, we investigated the effect of experimental air warming by open-top chambers (OTCs) on water-extractable organic matter (WEOM), microbial biomasses and enzymatic activities in two contrasted moisture sites named Bog and Fen sites, the latter considered as the wetter ones. While no or few changes in peat temperature and water content appeared under the overall effect of OTCs, we observed that air warming smoothed water content differences and led to a decrease in mean peat temperature at the warmed Bog sites. This thermal discrepancy between the two sites led to contrasting changes in microbial structure and activities: a rise in hydrolytic activity at the warmed Bog sites and a relative enhancement of bacterial biomass at the warmed Fen sites. These features were not associated with any change in WEOM properties namely carbon and sugar contents and aromaticity, suggesting that air warming did not trigger any shift in OM decomposition. Using various tools, we show that the use of single indicators of OM decomposition can lead to fallacious conclusions. Lastly, these patterns may change seasonally as a consequence of complex interactions between groundwater level and air warming, suggesting the need to improve our knowledge using a high time-resolution approach.

The region underwent large climatic shifts during the Late Quaternary, with dramatic impacts on water resources and human populations. This paper presents the unique long-term hydroclimatic record (ca. 400 ka) from Northern Levant, derived from a sediment core taken from a small tectonic basin of northern Lebanon, the currently wettest area of the Levant. Combined biotic (pollen, biologic aquatic remains) and abiotic proxies (sediment properties, carbonate oxygen isotopes) reveal relatively high water availability during interglacials and generally drier glacials periods during the past four climate cycles. These general trends are in line with pollen records from southeastern and near east Mediterranean areas, but differ from some paleohydrological records from the southern Levant. Southward migrations of the rain-bearing mid-latitude westerlies during glacial periods and regional land topography are likely to explain the observed regional climate signatures. In addition, distinctive climate signatures of the successive wetter/drier intervals reflect interactions between global forcing (insolation, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration), eastern Mediterranean Sea surface conditions intimately linked to North Atlantic climate and to ice-sheet and sea-ice extent at high northern latitudes, land topography, and local hydrogeological processes. Our record brings new benchmarks for understanding the spatial heterogeneity of eastern Mediterranean responses to global climate changes.

Most of the inter-model spread in the diurnal mean marine shortwave cloud feedback can be explained by low cloud responses, although these do not explain the model responses at the neutral/weakly negative end of the feedback range, where changes in mid and high level cloud properties are more important. All of the models show reductions in marine low cloud fraction in the warmer climate, and these are in almost all cases largest in the mornings when more cloud is present in the control simulations. This results in shortwave cloud feedbacks being slightly stronger and having the largest inter-model spread at this time of day. The diurnal amplitudes of the responses of marine cloud properties to the warming climate are however small compared to the inter-model differences in their diurnally meaned responses. This indicates that the diurnal cycle of cloud feedback is not strongly relevant to understanding inter-model spread in overall cloud feedback and climate sensitivity.

Rapid warming has begun to lift this barrier(3), potentially facilitating the interchange of marine biota between the two seas(4). Here, we forecast the potential northward progression of 515 fish species following climate change, and report the rate of potential species interchange between the Atlantic and the Pacific via the Northwest Passage and the Northeast Passage. For this, we projected niche-based models under climate change scenarios and simulated the spread of species through the passages when climatic conditions became suitable. Results reveal a complex range of responses during this century, and accelerated interchange after 2050. By 2100 up to 41 species could enter the Pacific and 44 species could enter the Atlantic, via one or both passages. Consistent with historical and recent biodiversity interchanges(5,6), this exchange of fish species may trigger changes for biodiversity and food webs in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, with ecological and economic consequences to ecosystems that at present contribute 39% to global marine fish landings.;;"CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTH-ATLANTIC; GREENLAND WATERS; MARINE FISHES; OCEAN; INVASION; SHIFTS";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Wisz, M.

LocationThe Mediterranean Sea, where sea surface temperatures are expected to strongly increase by the end of the 21st century, represents an archetypal situation with a dense MPA network but resource overexploitation outside. MethodsUsing an individual-based mechanistic model of larval transport, forced with an emission-driven regional climate change scenario for the Mediterranean Sea, we explored the combined effects of changes in hydrodynamics, adult reproductive timing and larval dispersal on the connectivity among MPAs and their ability to seed fished areas with larvae. ResultsWe show that, over the period 1970-2099, larval dispersal distances would decrease by 10%, the continental shelf area seeded with larvae would decrease by 3% and the larval retention fraction would increase by 5%, resulting in higher concentration of larvae in smaller areas of the continental shelf. However, connectance within the MPA network would increase by 5% as more northern MPAs would become suitable for reproduction with increasing temperatures. We also show that the effects of changes in adult reproductive timing and larval dispersal on connectivity patterns are additive. Main conclusionsClimate change will influence connectivity and the effectiveness of MPA networks, and should receive more attention in future conservation planning and large-scale population dynamics.;"Biophysical model; conservation planning; Epinephelus marginatus; larval dispersal; larval growth rate; reproductive timing";"GROUPER EPINEPHELUS-MARGINATUS; WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEA; DUSKY GROUPER; POPULATION CONNECTIVITY; PISCES SERRANIDAE; RESERVE NETWORKS; CORAL-REEFS; CONSERVATION; DISPERSAL; BIODIVERSITY";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";"[Andrello, Marco; Manel, Stephanie] Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, LPED UMR 151, Marseille, France; [Andrello, Marco; Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LECA, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Andrello, Marco; Thuiller, Wilfried] CNRS, LECA, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Mouillot, David] Univ Montpellier 2, UMR Ecol Syst Marins Cotiers 5119, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France; [Mouillot, David] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Somot, Samuel] Meteo France, CNRM, GAME, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Manel, Stephanie] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev, UMR AMAP, Montpellier, France";Andrello, M (reprint author), Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, LPED UMR 151, Marseille, France.;"Australia; France";"Australia; France";"AUS; FRA";0;DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS;;;;;21;2;139;150;;10.1111/ddi.12250;1366-9516;1472-4642;;1366-9516 eISSN: 1472-4642;;oui;1;2015;oui;1;2015;"Botanique et modélisation de l'architecture des plantes et des végétations (AMAP), UMR5120; Ecologie des systèmes marins côtiers (ECOSYM), UMR5119; Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), URA1357; Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553";"Botanique et modélisation de l'architecture des plantes et des végétations (AMAP), UMR5120; Centre pour la biodiversité marine, l'exploitation et la conservation (MARBEC), UMR9190; Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), UMR3589; Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553";"UMR5119; UMR5120; UMR5553; URA1357";"UMR3589; UMR5120; UMR5553; UMR9190";5 - Exceptionelle

These changes can be related to the ground temperature and to climate warming. In most cases, rock glaciers do not represent any serious hazard, except the instability of their surface and local rockfalls at the steep front. The surface movements, though moderate, can nevertheless cause damages to sensible infrastructures like cableways or buildings, if these are not designed to adapt to surface movements. The strong accelerations observed on some rock glaciers, however, induce a change of magnitude, and may threaten in some cases downslope areas. Thus, the presence of active or inactive rock glaciers with high ice content must be considered not only with regard to present conditions and dynamics, but with respect to possible evolutions due to climate change.;"Permafrost; Rock glaciers; Hazards";"PERMAFROST; AUSTRIA; CLIMATE; ALPS";"Engineering; Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Engineering, Geological; Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary";"[Schoeneich, P.; Echelard, T.] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Inst Geog Alpine, Grenoble, France; [Bodin, X.] Univ Savoie, CNRS, EDYTEM, Le Bourget Du Lac, France; [Kaufmann, V.] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Remote Sensing & Photogrammetry, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Kellerer-Pirklbauer, A.; Lieb, G.

This paper addresses this issue by focusing on the Temara region in Morocco. The study area was selected for two main reasons. First, it contains numerous caves with Upper Pleistocene deposits, which have yielded remains of anatomically modern humans in association with Aterian and lberomaurusian artifacts. Second, these caves are currently located on the shore, thus this region is particularly sensitive to major climate change and sea level fluctuations. Diachronic taphonomic study of faunal remains from two sites in the region, El Harhoura 2 and El Mnasra caves, shows alternating human/non-human predator occupations. The lower layers of El Mnasra Cave dating to Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 5 have yielded diverse ungulate remains with significant anthropogenic impact marks, together with numerous mollusk shells, Nassarius shell beads, hearths, lithics, some bone tools and used pigments. Faunal remains from the upper layers dating to OIS 4, 3 and 2 of El Harhoura 2 and El Mnasra caves, largely dominated by gazelles, provide evidence of carnivore activities, such as tooth marks, numerous semi-digested bones and coprolites alongside some anthropogenic signatures (cut marks and burnt bones). Non-human predators appear to be the main agents responsible for faunal modifications and accumulations. The 'non-intensive' nature of human occupation is confirmed by analyses of the lithic industry at El Harhoura 2. The 'intensive' human occupations date to OIS 5 and could have taken place during wet periods in connection with high sea levels, which allowed the exploitation of shellfish in this area. 'Non-intensive' human occupations generally correspond to arid periods and lower sea levels, during which the Temara area was further inland and may have been less attractive to humans.

The current emissions trajectory would rapidly and significantly alter many ecosystems and the associated services on which humans heavily depend. A reduced emissions scenario-consistent with the Copenhagen Accord's goal of a global temperature increase of less than 2 degrees C-is much more favorable to the ocean but still substantially alters important marine ecosystems and associated goods and services.

If implemented, the cost of electricity generated by a fossil fuel-burning power plant would rise substantially, owing to the expense of removing CO2 from the effluent stream. There is therefore an urgent need for more efficient gas separation technologies, such as those potentially offered by advanced solid adsorbents. Here we show that diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks can behave as 'phase-change' adsorbents, with unusual step-shaped CO2 adsorption isotherms that shift markedly with temperature. Results from spectroscopic, diffraction and computational studies show that the origin of the sharp adsorption step is an unprecedented cooperative process in which, above a metal-dependent threshold pressure, CO2 molecules insert into metal-amine bonds, inducing a reorganization of the amines into well-ordered chains of ammonium carbamate. As a consequence, large CO2 separation capacities can be achieved with small temperature swings, and regeneration energies appreciably lower than achievable withstate-of-the-art aqueous amine solutions become feasible. The results provide a mechanistic framework for designing highly efficient adsorbents for removing CO2 from various gas mixtures, and yield insights into the conservation of Mg2+ within the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase family of enzymes.;;"CARBON-DIOXIDE CAPTURE; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; AUGMENTED-WAVE METHOD; COORDINATION POLYMER; POWDER DIFFRACTION; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; BASIS-SET; FLUE-GAS; ADSORPTION";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[McDonald, Thomas M.; Mason, Jarad A.; Bloch, Eric D.; Gygi, David; Long, Jeffrey R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kong, Xueqian; Vlaisavljevich, Bess; Schnell, Sondre K.; Lee, Kyuho; Smit, Berend; Reimer, Jeffrey A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kong, Xueqian] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Chem, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Dani, Alessandro; Crocella, Valentina; Giordanino, Filippo; Bordiga, Silvia] Univ Turin, NIS & INSTM Ctr Reference, Dept Chem, I-10135 Turin, Italy; [Odoh, Samuel O.; Dzubak, Allison L.; Planas, Nora; Gagliardi, Laura] Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem, Chem Theory Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Odoh, Samuel O.; Dzubak, Allison L.; Planas, Nora; Gagliardi, Laura] Univ Minnesota, Supercomp Inst, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Drisdell, Walter S.; Smit, Berend; Kortright, Jeffrey B.; Reimer, Jeffrey A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mat Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Poloni, Roberta] Univ Grenoble Alpes, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Poloni, Roberta] Sci & Ingn Mat & Proc SIMAP, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Poloni, Roberta] CNRS, SIMAP, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Schnell, Sondre K.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Pascal, Tod; Wan, Liwen F.; Prendergast, David; Neaton, Jeffrey B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Mol Foundry, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Neaton, Jeffrey B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Neaton, Jeffrey B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Kavli Energy Nanosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Smit, Berend] EPFL, Inst Sci & Ingn Chim, Valais, CH-1950 Sion, Switzerland";Long, JR (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;"France; Italy; Norway; People's Republic of China; Switzerland; United States";"France; Italy; Norway; People's Republic of China; Switzerland; United States";"CHE; CHN; FRA; ITA; NOR; USA";19;NATURE;;;;;519;7543;303;+;;10.1038/nature14327;0028-0836;1476-4687;;0028-0836 eISSN: 1476-4687;;oui;1;2015;oui;1;2015;Sciences et Ingenierie, des MAtériaux et Procédés (SIMAP), UMR5266;Sciences et Ingenierie, des MAtériaux et Procédés (SIMAP), UMR5266;UMR5266;UMR5266;5 - Exceptionelle

To determine whether responses by the fish assemblage were due to changes in water quality or to other factors, comparisons were made with the structure of a fish assemblage from a nearby site unaffected by sewage effluent. Total species richness, density and biomass of fish, decreased at both sites over the 30-year period. An increase in mean trophic level near the sewage outlet following improvements in water quality indicated that wastewater treatment had another important effect. This result is consistent with the reductions in food webs supporting pelagic and benthic fishes that typically accompany decreases in nutrient inputs. Although improvements to wastewater treatment explained much of the variation in the structure of the fish assemblage at PC, our results also suggest that fishing and climate change, at both sites.

Information was gathered from scientists, practitioners, and managers active in the WIO region through a questionnaire and a workshop. The experts stated that the productive intertidal environment is highly valuable for reasons such as recreation, erosion protection, and provision of edible invertebrates and fish. Several anthropogenic pressures were identified, including pollution, harbor activities, overexploitation, and climate change. The experts considered the WIO intertidal zone as generally understudied, undermanaged, and with poor or no monitoring. The most important management strategies according to the expert opinions are to develop and involve local people in integrated coastal zone management (ICZM), to increase knowledge on species-environment relationships, and to develop awareness campaigns and education programs.

Thus, the present model simulates both mussel growth and sexual cycle steps according to food availability and water temperature and also the effect of climate change on mussel behavior and reproduction. The results point to good concordance between simulations and growth parameters (metric length and weight) for mussels in the lagoon.

This review intends to evaluate the effects of both climate and anthropogenic perturbations on the carbon balance of the Brazilian Amazon and to understand how they interact with each other. By analysing the outputs of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 4 (AR4) model ensemble, we demonstrate that Amazonian temperatures and water stress are both likely to increase over the 21st Century. Curbing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by 62% in 2010 relative to the 1990s mean decreased the Brazilian Amazon's deforestation contribution to global land use carbon emissions from 17% in the 1990s and early 2000s to 9% by 2010. Carbon sources in Amazonia are likely to be dominated by climatic impacts allied with forest fires (48.3% relative contribution) during extreme droughts. The current net carbon sink (net biome productivity, NBP) of +0.16 (ranging from +0.11 to +0.21) Pg C year(-1) in the Brazilian Amazon, equivalent to 13.3% of global carbon emissions from land-use change for 2008, can be negated or reversed during drought years [NBP = -0.06 (-0.31 to +0.01) Pg C year(-1)]. Therefore, reducing forest fires, in addition to reducing deforestation, would be an important measure for minimizing future emissions. Conversely, doubling the current area of secondary forests and avoiding additional removal of primary forests would help the Amazonian gross forest sink to offset approximately 42% of global land-use change emissions. We conclude that a few strategic environmental policy measures are likely to strengthen the Amazonian net carbon sink with global implications. Moreover, these actions could increase the resilience of the net carbon sink to future increases in drought frequency.;"carbon emissions; recovery; drought; fire; climate; secondary forests; deforestation";"NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; BRAZILIAN AMAZON; TROPICAL FORESTS; RAIN-FOREST; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FIRE SUSCEPTIBILITY; POSITIVE FEEDBACKS; SECONDARY FORESTS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; TREE MORTALITY";Biology & Biochemistry;Biology;"[Aragao, Luiz E.

We investigate Greenland temperature evolution during the last deglaciation using independent reconstructions from three ice cores and simulations with a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model. Contrary to the traditional delta O-18 interpretation, the Younger Dryas period was 4.5 degrees +/- 2 degrees C warmer than the Oldest Dryas, due to increased carbon dioxide forcing and summer insolation. The magnitude of abrupt temperature changes is larger in central Greenland (9 degrees to 14 degrees C) than in the northwest (5 degrees to 9 degrees C), fingerprinting a North Atlantic origin.

However, assessment of the capacity to predict natural variations of relevant biogeochemical variables like carbon fluxes, pH, or marine primary productivity remains unexplored. Among these, the net primary productivity (NPP) is of particular relevance in a forecasting perspective. Indeed, in regions like the tropical Pacific (30 degrees N-30 degrees S), NPP exhibits natural fluctuations at interannual to decadal timescales that have large impacts on marine ecosystems and fisheries. Here, we investigate predictions of NPP variations over the last decades (i.e., from 1997 to 2011) with an Earth system model within the tropical Pacific. Results suggest a predictive skill for NPP of 3 y, which is higher than that of sea surface temperature (1 y). We attribute the higher predictability of NPP to the poleward advection of nutrient anomalies (nitrate and iron), which sustain fluctuations in phytoplankton productivity over several years. These results open previously unidentified perspectives to the development of science-based management approaches to marine resources relying on integrated physical-biogeochemical forecasting systems.;"forecast; ecosystem management; marine biogeochemistry";"SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; EQUATORIAL PACIFIC; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; CLIMATE; OCEAN; ATLANTIC; DISTRIBUTIONS; SALINITY; NITROGEN; MODEL";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Seferian, Roland] Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Grp Meteorol Grande Echelle & Climat, Grp Etude Atmosphere Meteorol, F-31100 Toulouse, France; [Seferian, Roland; Bopp, Laurent; Gehlen, Marion; Swingedouw, Didier; Servonnat, Jerome] Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Swingedouw, Didier] Univ Bordeaux, F-33615 Pessac, France; [Mignot, Juliette; Guilyardi, Eric] Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Lab Oceanog & Climat Expt & Approches, F-75252 Paris, France; [Mignot, Juliette] Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys Phys Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Mignot, Juliette] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Guilyardi, Eric] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci Climate, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Guilyardi, Eric] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci Climate, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England";Seferian, R (reprint author), Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Grp Meteorol Grande Echelle & Climat, Grp Etude Atmosphere Meteorol, F-31100 Toulouse, France.;"France; Switzerland; United Kingdom";"France; Switzerland; United Kingdom";"CHE; FRA; GBR";1;PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA;;;;;111;32;11646;11651;;10.1073/pnas.1315855111;0027-8424;;;0027-8424;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;"Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), UMR3589; Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire d'Océanographie et du Climat : Expérimentations et Approches Numériques (LOCEAN), UMR7159; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), UMR3589; Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire d'Océanographie et du Climat : Expérimentations et Approches Numériques (LOCEAN), UMR7159; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"FR636; UMR3589; UMR7159; UMR8212";"FR636; UMR3589; UMR7159; UMR8212";5 - Exceptionelle

The severe short-term droughts that occurred recently in Amazonia have drawn attention to the vulnerability of tropical forests to climatic disturbances(4-9). The central African rainforests, the second-largest on Earth, have experienced a long-term drying trend(10,11) whose impacts on vegetation dynamics remain mostly unknown because in situ observations are very limited. The Congolese forest, with its drier conditions and higher percentage of semi-evergreen trees(12,13), may be more tolerant to short-term rainfall reduction than are wetter tropical forests(11), but for a long-term drought there may be critical thresholds of water availability below which higher-biomass, closed-canopy forests transition to more open, lower-biomass forests(1,2,14). Here we present observational evidence for a widespread decline in forest greenness over the past decade based on analyses of satellite data (optical, thermal, microwave and gravity) from several independent sensors over the Congo basin. This decline in vegetation greenness, particularly in the northern Congolese forest, is generally consistent with decreases in rainfall, terrestrial water storage, water content in aboveground woody and leaf biomass, and the canopy backscatter anomaly caused by changes in structure and moisture in upper forest layers. It is also consistent with increases in photosynthetically active radiation and land surface temperature. These multiple lines of evidence indicate that this large-scale vegetation browning, or loss of photosynthetic capacity, may be partially attributable to the long-term drying trend. Our results suggest that a continued gradual decline of photosynthetic capacity and moisture content driven by the persistent drying trend could alter the composition and structure of the Congolese forest to favour the spread of drought-tolerant species(1,2,14).;;"VEGETATION INDEXES; MICROWAVE EMISSION; TROPICAL FORESTS; DRY SEASON; MODIS; DROUGHT; CLIMATE; AMAZON; RETRIEVALS; PRODUCTS";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Zhou, Liming] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Tian, Yuhong] NOAA, IMSG, NESDIS, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res,STAR, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Ciais, Philippe] UVSQ, CEA, CNRS, LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Saatchi, Sassan] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Liu, Yi Y.] Univ New S Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Liu, Yi Y.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chen, Haishan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Vermote, Eric F.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Song, Conghe] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog, Chapel Hill, NC 29599 USA; [Song, Conghe] Anhui Agr Univ, Sch Forestry & Landscape Architecture, Hefei 230036, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Hwang, Taehee] Univ N Carolina, Inst Environm, Chapel Hill, NC 29599 USA";Zhou, LM (reprint author), SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA.;"Australia; France; People's Republic of China; United States";"Australia; France; People's Republic of China; United States";"AUS; CHN; FRA; USA";20;NATURE;;;;;509;7498;86;+;;10.1038/nature13265;0028-0836;1476-4687;;0028-0836 eISSN: 1476-4687;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;UMR8212;UMR8212;5 - Exceptionelle

J. Mark; Delorme, Daniel; Warnant, Claude; Bonenfant, Christophe";PLOS BIOLOGY Volume: 12 Issue: 4 Article Number: e1001828 Published: 2014;English;Article;Marked impacts of climate change on biodiversity have frequently been demonstrated, including temperature-related shifts in phenology and life-history traits. One potential major impact of climate change is the modification of synchronization between the phenology of different trophic levels. High phenotypic plasticity in laying date has allowed many bird species to track the increasingly early springs resulting from recent environmental change, but although changes in the timing of reproduction have been well studied in birds, these questions have only recently been addressed in mammals. To track peak resource availability, large herbivores like roe deer, with a widespread distribution across Europe, should also modify their life-history schedule in response to changes in vegetation phenology over time. In this study, we analysed the influence of climate change on the timing of roe deer births and the consequences for population demography and individual fitness. Our study provides a rare quantification of the demographic costs associated with the failure of a species to modify its phenology in response to a changing world. Given these fitness costs, the lack of response of roe deer birth dates to match the increasingly earlier onset of spring is in stark contrast with the marked phenotypic responses to climate change reported in many other mammals. We suggest that the lack of phenotypic plasticity in birth timing in roe deer is linked to its inability to track environmental cues of variation in resource availability for the timing of parturition. Author Summary Climate change can alter the synchronization of life cycles between organisms at different points in the food chain. If species do not respond to climate change, the timing of peak resource availability may fail to match the timing of peak energy expenditure. Many bird species have been able to advance their laying date to match a change in the timing of caterpillar abundance. Herbivores are similarly expected to track changes in the timing of vegetation growth. In this study, we combine statistical analysis with demographic modeling to analyze the influence of a climate-driven shift in the timing of the spring vegetation flush on the birth date and demography of roe deer. In recent years, climate change has generated a marked increase in local temperatures and a progressively earlier vegetation flush. Despite these changes, we observed no shift in timing of the birth date of roe deer over the 27-year study period. This failure to track environmental change resulted in a mismatch between vegetation flush and birth date, which in turn caused a decrease in survival of the young, and hence a reduction in roe deer fitness. Birth date was under strong directional selection, but was not strongly heritable, suggesting that any evolutionary response of birth date to climate change might be limited. We suggest that a plastic response in birth date did not occur because reproduction is triggered by day length rather than resource availability in roe deer.;;"GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS; WILD BIRD; DELAYED IMPLANTATION; POPULATION-GROWTH; FITNESS COSTS; BREEDING DATE; LIFE-HISTORY; SELECTION";"Biology & Biochemistry; Molecular Biology & Genetics";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology";"[Plard, Floriane; Gaillard, Jean-Michel; Bonenfant, Christophe] Univ Lyon 1, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, UMR 5558, F-69365 Lyon, France; [Coulson, Tim] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Hewison, A.

Seven global vegetation models are used to analyze possible responses to future climate simulated by a range of general circulation models run under all four representative concentration pathway scenarios of changing concentrations of greenhouse gases. All 110 simulations predict an increase in global vegetation carbon to 2100, but with substantial variation between vegetation models. For example, at 4 C of global land surface warming (510-758 ppm of CO2), vegetation carbon increases by 52-477 Pg C (224 Pg C mean), mainly due to CO2 fertilization of photosynthesis. Simulations agree on large regional increases across much of the boreal forest, western Amazonia, central Africa, western China, and southeast Asia, with reductions across southwestern North America, central South America, southern Mediterranean areas, southwestern Africa, and southwestern Australia. Four vegetation models display discontinuities across 4 degrees C of warming, indicating global thresholds in the balance of positive and negative influences on productivity and biomass. In contrast to previous global vegetation model studies, we emphasize the importance of uncertainties in projected changes in carbon residence times. We find, when all seven models are considered for one representative concentration pathway x general circulation model combination, such uncertainties explain 30% more variation in modeled vegetation carbon change than responses of net primary productivity alone, increasing to 151% for non-HYBRID4 models.

The eco-physiological plasticity of this species was evaluated by studying plants growing at two sites with different soil moistures on the island of Elba (Italy), through dendrochronological, wood-anatomical analyses and stable isotopes measurements. Intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) were abundant in tree rings, and were identified as the key parameter to understand site-specific plant responses to water stress. Our findings showed that the formation of IADFs is mainly related to the high temperature, precipitation patterns and probably to soil water availability, which differs at the selected study sites. The recorded increase in the C-13-derived intrinsic water use efficiency at the IADFs level was linked to reduced water loss rather than to increasing C assimilation. The variation in vessel size and the different absolute values of O-18 among trees growing at the two study sites underlined possible differences in stomatal control of water loss and possible differences in sources of water uptake. This approach not only helped monitor seasonal environmental differences through tree-ring width, but also added valuable information on E.arborea responses to drought and their ecological implications for Mediterranean vegetation dynamics.;"dendrochronology; false ring; Mediterranean ecosystems; water stress; wood anatomy";"OXYGEN-ISOTOPE RATIOS; TREE-RING WIDTH; MEDITERRANEAN CISTUS-INCANUS; VAPOR-PRESSURE DEFICIT; PINUS-HALEPENSIS; QUERCUS-ILEX; CLIMATIC SIGNIFICANCE; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; STABLE-ISOTOPES; RIPARIAN TREES";Plant & Animal Science;Plant Sciences;"[Battipaglia, Giovanna] Univ Naples 2, Dept Environm Biol & Pharmaceut Sci & Technol, I-81100 Caserta, Italy; [Battipaglia, Giovanna] Univ Montpellier 2, Ctr Bioarchaeol & Ecol, Inst Bot, Ecole Prat Hautes Etud PALECO EPHE, F-34090 Montpellier, France; [De Micco, Veronica; Aronne, Giovanna] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, I-80055 Naples, Italy; [Brand, Willi A.; Linke, Petra] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; [Saurer, Matthias] Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Cherubini, Paolo] Swiss Fed Res Inst, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland";Battipaglia, G (reprint author), Univ Naples 2, Dept Environm Biol & Pharmaceut Sci & Technol, I-81100 Caserta, Italy.;"France; Germany; Italy; Switzerland";"France; Germany; Italy; Switzerland";"CHE; DEU; FRA; ITA";12;PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT;;;;;37;2;382;391;;10.1111/pce.12160;0140-7791;1365-3040;;0140-7791 eISSN: 1365-3040;;oui;1;2014;oui;1;2014;Centre de bio-archéologie et d'écologie (CBAE), UMR5059;Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier (ISEM), UMR5554;UMR5059;UMR5554;5 - Exceptionelle

Among observed changes, modifications in bird phenology have been widely documented. However, most studies have interpreted phenological shifts as gradual biological adjustments in response to the alteration of the thermal regime. Here we analysed a long-term dataset (1980-2010) of short-distance migratory raptors in five European regions. We revealed that the responses of these birds to climate-induced changes in autumn temperatures are abrupt and synchronous at a continental scale. We found that when the temperatures increased, birds delayed their mean passage date of autumn migration. Such delay, in addition to an earlier spring migration, suggests that a significant warming may induce an extension of the breeding-area residence time of migratory raptors, which may eventually lead to residency.;;"BIRD POPULATION; ARRIVAL; DATES; REPRODUCTION; SELECTION; PATTERNS; MIGRANTS; PLANKTON; IMPACT; SEA";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Jaffre, Mikael; Beaugrand, Gregory; Goberville, Eric; Luczak, Christophe] Univ Lille 1, Stn Marine Wimereux, CNRS, Lab Oceanol & Geosci,LOG,UMR 8187, Wimereux, France; [Jiguet, Frederic] UPMC, MNHN, Ctr Rech Biol Populat Oiseaux, CNRS,UMR 7204, Paris, France; [Kjellen, Nils] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Lund, Sweden; [Dubois, Philippe J.] Trektellen Org, SOVON Dutch Ctr Field Ornithol, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Dubois, Philippe J.] Ligue Protect Oiseaux, Rochefort, France; [Lepretre, Alain] Univ Lille 1, UPRES, EA 4515, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Luczak, Christophe] Univ Artois, IUFM, Gravelines, France";Jaffre, M (reprint author), Univ Lille 1, Stn Marine Wimereux, CNRS, Lab Oceanol & Geosci,LOG,UMR 8187, Wimereux, France.;"France; Netherlands; Sweden";"France; Netherlands; Sweden";"FRA; NLD; SWE";4;PLOS ONE;;;;;8;11;;;e79112;10.1371/journal.pone.0079112;1932-6203;;;1932-6203;;oui;1;2013;oui;1;2013;"Centre des Sciences de la Conservation (CESCO), UMR7204; Laboratoire d'océanologie et de géosciences (LOG), UMR8187";"Centre des Sciences de la Conservation (CESCO), UMR7204; Laboratoire d'océanologie et de géosciences (LOG), UMR8187";"UMR7204; UMR8187";"UMR7204; UMR8187";4 - Excellente

Given regional differences in climate change, shifts in phenology will not be uniform across the globe, and conclusions drawn from temperate systems in the northern hemisphere might not be applicable to other regions on the planet. We conduct the largest meta-analysis to date of phenological drivers and trends among southern hemisphere species, assessing 1208 long-term datasets from 89 studies on 347 species. Data were mostly from Australasia (Australia and New Zealand), South America and the Antarctic/subantarctic, and focused primarily on plants and birds. This meta-analysis shows an advance in the timing of spring events (with a strong Australian data bias), although substantial differences in trends were apparent among taxonomic groups and regions. When only statistically significant trends were considered, 82% of terrestrial datasets and 42% of marine datasets demonstrated an advance in phenology. Temperature was most frequently identified as the primary driver of phenological changes; however, in many studies it was the only climate variable considered. When precipitation was examined, it often played a key role but, in contrast with temperature, the direction of phenological shifts in response to precipitation variation was difficult to predict a priori. We discuss how phenological information can inform the adaptive capacity of species, their resilience, and constraints on autonomous adaptation. We also highlight serious weaknesses in past and current data collection and analyses at large regional scales (with very few studies in the tropics or from Africa) and dramatic taxonomic biases.

All were extinct by the end of the Miocene in Western Eurasia. Here, we investigate the hypothesis of climate and vegetation changes at a local scale when the cercopithecoid Mesopithecus replaced the hominoid Ouranopithecus along the Axios River, Greece. Because they are herbivorous and were much more abundant than primates, bovids are preferred to primates to study climate change in the Balkans as a cause of hominoid extinction. By measuring carbon stable isotope ratios of bovid enamel, we conclude that Ouranopithecus and Mesopithecus both evolved in pure C-3 environments. However, the large range of delta C-13 values of apatite carbonate from bovids combined with their molar microwear and mesowear patterns preclude the presence of dense forested landscapes in northern Greece. Instead, these bovids evolved in rather open landscapes with abundant grasses in the herbaceous layer. Coldest monthly estimated temperatures were below 10 degrees C and warmest monthly temperatures rose close to or above 20 degrees C for the two time intervals. Oxygen isotope compositions of phosphate from bulk samples did not show significant differences between sites but did show between-species variation within each site. Different factors influence oxygen isotope composition in this context, including water provenience, feeding ecology, body mass, and rate of amelogenesis. We discuss this latter factor in regard to the high intra-tooth variations in delta O-18(p) reflecting important amplitudes of seasonal variations in temperature. These estimations fit with paleobotanical data and differ slightly from estimations based on climate models. This study found no significant change in climate before and after the extinction of Ouranopithecus along the Axios River. However, strong seasonal variations with relatively cold winters were indicated, conditions quite usual for extant monkeys but unusual for great apes distributed today in inter-tropical regions.

Here, we report an 8000-year mass balance record from the Nile Delta to reconstruct when and how this sedimentary basin has responded to past hydrological shifts. In a global Holocene context, the long-term decrease in Nile Delta accretion rates is consistent with insolation-driven changes in the 'monsoon pacemaker', attested throughout the mid-latitude tropics. Following the early to mid-Holocene growth of the Nile's deltaic plain, sediment losses and pronounced erosion are first recorded after similar to 4000 years ago, the corollaries of falling sediment supply and an intensification of anthropogenic impacts from the Pharaonic period onwards. Against the backcloth of the Saharan 'depeopling', reduced river flow underpinned by a weakening of monsoonal precipitation appears to have been particularly conducive to the expansion of human activities on the delta by exposing productive floodplain lands for occupation and irrigation agriculture. The reconstruction suggests that the Nile Delta has a particularly long history of vulnerability to extreme events (e. g. floods and storms) and sea-level rise, although the present sediment-starved system does not have a direct Holocene analogue.

Dinoflagellates were dominant among plankton, accounting for 73.9 % of the lagoon's overall plankton community, and were comprised of 25 different species among which 17 were reported in the literature as harmful. While no significant difference was found in the distribution of dinoflagellates among the stations, a strong monthly difference was observed. This temporal variability was due to an increase in the abundance of Prorocentrum micans from December to February, leading to a strong decrease in the Shannon diversity index from station to station. At the onset of P. micans development, dinoflagellate abundances reached 1.26.10(5) cells l(-1). A redundance analysis indicates that both temperature and salinity have a significant effect on the dynamics of the dinoflagellate community. Using a generalized additive model, both temperature and salinity appear to have significant nonlinear relationships with P. micans abundances. Model predictions indicate that outbreaks of P. micans may occur at a temperature below 22.5 A degrees C and with salinity above 32.5.

Located above the treeline (>= 4000 m a.s.l.), they share common features with temperate alpine lakes, which impose extreme conditions on their aquatic organisms: e. g., strong winds, broad diel variations in water temperature, and intense solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). However, because of their latitude, they differ in two major ecological characteristics: they lack ice cover during the winter and they do not present summer water column stratification. We sampled 26 tropical high-altitude Andean lakes from three regions of the Bolivian Eastern Andes Cordillera during the wet period (austral summer). We performed an ordination to better describe the typology of Andean lakes in relation to the environmental variables, and we assessed the relationships among them, focussing on the UV-A transparency (360 nm) throughout the water column. We found a positive correlation between UV-A transparency calculated as Z(1%) (the depth which reaches 1% of the surface UV-A), the lake maximum depth and Secchi transparency (r = 0.61). Z(1%) of UV-A was smaller in shallow lakes than in deep lakes, indicating that shallow lakes are less transparent to UV-A than deep lakes. We hypothesize that, compared to shallow lakes, deep lakes (maximum depth > 10 m) may have lower dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (that absorb UV radiation) due to lower temperature and reduced macrophyte cover. Based on our data, tropical high-altitude Andean lakes are less transparent to UV-A (K-d range = 1.4-11.0 m (1); Z(1%) depth range = 0.4-3.2 m) than typical temperate alpine lakes (1-6 m (1), 3-45 m, respectively). Moreover, they differ in vertical profiles of UV-A, chlorophyll-a, and temperature, suggesting that they may have a distinct ecological functioning. Such peculiarities justify treating tropical high-altitude Andean lakes as a separate category of alpine lakes. Tropical high-altitude Andean lakes have been poorly studied. Thus they deserve more in-depth studies in the face of global changes regarding the use of their UV transparency as a sentinel proxy of climate changes, particularly global warming.";;"SOLAR ULTRAVIOLET-RADIATION; DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; CONSERVATION PRIORITIES; BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; PHYTOPLANKTON; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; TRANSPARENCY; BOLIVIA";"Biology & Biochemistry; Chemistry; Molecular Biology & Genetics";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics; Chemistry, Physical";"[Aguilera, Ximena; Lazzaro, Xavier; Coronel, Jorge S.] Univ Mayor San Simon, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Biol, Unidad Limnol & Recursos Acuat, Cochabamba, Bolivia; [Lazzaro, Xavier] UPMC, Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR BOREA MNHN IRD 7208 207, CNRS, F-75231 Paris 05, France";Aguilera, X (reprint author), Univ Mayor San Simon, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Biol, Unidad Limnol & Recursos Acuat, Calle Sucre & Parque Torre S-N, Cochabamba, Bolivia.;"Bolivia; France";"Bolivia; France";"BOL; FRA";1;PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES;;;;;12;9;1649;1657;;10.1039/c3pp25285j;1474-905X;1474-9092;;1474-905X eISSN: 1474-9092;;oui;1;2013;oui;1;2013;Biologie des organismes et écosystèmes aquatiques (BOREA), UMR7208;Biologie des organismes et écosystèmes aquatiques (BOREA), UMR7208;UMR7208;UMR7208;2 - Acceptable

Resulting phenological mismatches can drive simultaneous changes in natural selection and population demography, but the links between these interacting processes are poorly understood. Here we analyse 37 years of data from an individual-based study of great tits (Parus major) in the Netherlands and use mixed-effects models to separate the within- and across-year effects of phenological mismatch between great tits and caterpillars (a key food source for developing nestlings) on components of fitness at the individual and population levels. Several components of individual fitness were affected by individual mismatch (i.e. late breeding relative to the caterpillar food peak date), including the probability of double-brooding, fledgling success, offspring recruitment probability and the number of recruits. Together these effects contributed to an overall negative relationship between relative fitness and laying dates, that is, selection for earlier laying on average. Directional selection for earlier laying was stronger in years where birds bred on average later than the food peak, but was weak or absent in years where the phenology of birds and caterpillars matched (i.e. no population mismatch). The mean number of fledglings per female was lower in years when population mismatch was high, in part because fewer second broods were produced. Population mismatch had a weak effect on the mean number of recruits per female, and no effect on mean adult survival, after controlling for the effects of breeding density and the quality of the autumnal beech (Fagus sylvatica) crop. These findings illustrate how climate change-induced mismatch can have strong effects on the relative fitness of phenotypes within years, but weak effects on mean demographic rates across years. We discuss various general mechanisms that influence the extent of coupling between breeding phenology, selection and population dynamics in open populations subject to strong density regulation and stochasticity.;"climate; demographic; fitness; mismatch; selection gradient; synchrony; timing; vital rates";"TITS PARUS-MAJOR; GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; GREAT TIT; FOOD AVAILABILITY; CLUTCH-SIZE; PHENOTYPIC SELECTION; AVIAN REPRODUCTION; EXTINCTION RISK; FEMALE PARENT; DENSITY";"Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Ecology; Zoology";"[Reed, Thomas E.; Visser, Marcel E.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Jenouvrier, Stephanie] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Jenouvrier, Stephanie] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France";Reed, TE (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, POB 50, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands.;"France; Netherlands; United States";"France; Netherlands; United States";"FRA; NLD; USA";30;JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY;;;;;82;1;131;144;;10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.02020.x;0021-8790;;;0021-8790;;oui;1;2013;oui;1;2013;Centre d'études biologiques de Chizé (CEBC), UPR1934;Centre d'études biologiques de Chizé (CEBC), UMR7372;UPR1934;UMR7372;5 - Exceptionelle

The integrated effect of these processes is reflected in the calcium carbonate compensation depth, which is the oceanic depth at which calcium carbonate is dissolved. Here we present a carbonate accumulation record that covers the past 53 million years from a depth transect in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The carbonate compensation depth tracks long-term ocean cooling, deepening from 3.0-3.5 kilometres during the early Cenozoic (approximately 55 million years ago) to 4.6 kilometres at present, consistent with an overall Cenozoic increase in weathering. We find large superimposed fluctuations in carbonate compensation depth during the middle and late Eocene. Using Earth system models, we identify changes in weathering and the mode of organic-carbon delivery as two key processes to explain these large-scale Eocene fluctuations of the carbonate compensation depth.";;"ANTARCTIC GLACIATION; CALCITE COMPENSATION; EARTH SYSTEM; OCEAN; MODEL; CYCLE; DIOXIDE; HISTORY; RELEASE; FLUXES";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Paelike, Heiko; Bohaty, Steven M.; Chun, Cecily O.

The data cover both the swash and surf zones. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and Multi-channel Singular Spectrum analysis (MSSA) methods are applied, on the shoreface, to three potential forcings: the monthly wave heights, the monthly mean water levels and the large scale atmospheric index known as the North Atlantic Oscillation. The patterns within these forcings are compared to the local bathymetric patterns; it is found that the patterns extracted using SSA and MSSA agree well with previous patterns identified using wavelets and confirm the highly non-stationary behaviour of beach levels at Duck. This is followed by analysis of potential correlations between the local bathymetry (at the two transects) and hydrodynamic and atmospheric patterns. The study is then extended to all measured bathymetric profiles, covering an area of 1100 m (alongshore) by 440 m (cross-shore). MSSA showed no collective inter-annual patterns of oscillations present in the bathymetry and the three potential forcings. Annual and semi-annual cycles within the bathymetry are found to be strongly correlated with the monthly wave height, in agreement with the SSA findings. Other collective intra-annual cycles besides the semi-annual were identified; they were all correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation.";;"NORTH-CAROLINA; WAVE CLIMATE; SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; SHORELINE RESPONSE; SANDBAR BEHAVIOR; BEACH PROFILES; TIME-SERIES; EVOLUTION; MORPHOLOGY";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Magar, Vanesa; Reeve, Dominic E.] Univ Plymouth, Coastal Engn Res Grp, Inst Marine, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Lefranc, Marc] Univ Sci & Technol Lille, Lab Phys Lasers Atomes Mol PhLAM, Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Lefranc, Marc] Univ Sci & Technol Lille, CERLA, UFR Phys, Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Hoyle, Rebecca B.] Univ Surrey, Dept Math, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England";Magar, V (reprint author), Univ Plymouth, Coastal Engn Res Grp, Inst Marine, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.;"France; United Kingdom";"France; United Kingdom";"FRA; GBR";0;PLOS ONE;;;;;7;6;;;e39196;10.1371/journal.pone.0039196;1932-6203;;;1932-6203;;oui;1;2012;oui;1;2012;Physique des lasers, atomes et molécules (PhLAM), UMR8523;Physique des lasers, atomes et molécules (PhLAM), UMR8523;UMR8523;UMR8523;4 - Excellente

Irrespective, the 'tragedy of the commons' is an increasing reality for more than 500 million people that rely on the biodiversity resources and services of tropical coral reefs, mangrove forests, seagrass beds and associated fisheries. These natural resources continue to decline despite major advances in our scientific understanding of how ecosystems and human populations interact, and the application of considerable conservation and management efforts at scales from local user communities to oceans. Greater effort will be required to avert increasing damage from over-exploitation, pollution and global climate change; all deriving from increasing exploitation driven by poverty and progress i.e. continuing to expand development indefinitely and extraction of resources at industrial scales. However, the 'tragedy' concept has been widely criticized as a simple metaphor for a much larger set of problems and solutions. We argue that the 'tragedy' is essentially real and will continue to threaten the lives of millions of people unless there are some major moral and policy shifts to reverse increasing damage to coastal habitats and resources. We agree with the conclusion by Hardin that the solution to the tragedy will not be through the application of natural sciences, but via implementing exceedingly difficult and controversial moral decisions. An extreme example of a moral and controversial direction suggested by Hardin was in re-examining the 'freedom to breed' as an inherent human value. The need for 'moral decisions' is even greater in 2012. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we present delta C-13(atm) data for the past 24,000 years derived from three independent records from two Antarctic ice cores. We conclude that a pronounced 0.3 per mil decrease in delta C-13(atm) during the early deglaciation can be best explained by upwelling of old, carbon-enriched waters in the Southern Ocean. Later in the deglaciation, regrowth of the terrestrial biosphere, changes in sea surface temperature, and ocean circulation governed the delta C-13(atm) evolution. During the Last Glacial Maximum, delta C-13(atm) and atmospheric CO2 concentration were essentially constant, which suggests that the carbon cycle was in dynamic equilibrium and that the net transfer of carbon to the deep ocean had occurred before then.;;"HIGH-RESOLUTION RECORD; LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; AGE; VENTILATION; GREENLAND; EXCHANGE; CYCLES; C-14";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Schmitt, Jochen; Schneider, Robert; Elsig, Joachim; Leuenberger, Daiana; Joos, Fortunat; Stocker, Thomas F.; Leuenberger, Markus; Fischer, Hubertus] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Schmitt, Jochen; Schneider, Robert; Elsig, Joachim; Leuenberger, Daiana; Joos, Fortunat; Stocker, Thomas F.; Leuenberger, Markus; Fischer, Hubertus] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Schmitt, Jochen; Koehler, Peter; Fischer, Hubertus] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Lourantou, Anna; Chappellaz, Jerome] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, LGGE, UMR 5183, F-38041 Grenoble, France";Schmitt, J (reprint author), Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.;"France; Germany; Switzerland";"France; Germany; Switzerland";"CHE; DEU; FRA";82;SCIENCE;;;;;336;6082;711;714;;10.1126/science.1217161;0036-8075;;;0036-8075;;oui;1;2012;oui;1;2012;Laboratoire de glaciologie et géophysique de l'environnement (LGGE), UMR5183;Laboratoire de glaciologie et géophysique de l'environnement (LGGE), UMR5183;UMR5183;UMR5183;5 - Exceptionelle

These assumptions allow model parameters to be estimated from current species ranges. Deterioration of growing conditions due to climate change, e.g. more severe drought, will cause local extinction. However, for many plant species, the predicted climate change of higher minimum temperatures and longer growing seasons means, improved growing conditions. Biogeographical models may under some circumstances predict that a species will become locally extinct, despite improved growing conditions, because they are based on an assumption of equilibrium and this forces the species range to match the species-specific macroclimatic thresholds. We argue that such model predictions should be rejected unless there is evidence either that competition influences the position of the range margins or that a certain physiological mechanism associated with the apparent improvement in growing conditions negatively affects the species performance. We illustrate how a process-based vegetation model can be used to ascertain whether such a physiological cause exists. To avoid potential modelling errors of this type, we propose a method that constrains the scenario predictions of the envelope models by changing the geographical distribution of the dominant plant functional type. Consistent modelling results are very important for evaluating how changes in species areas affect local functional trait diversity and hence ecosystem functioning and resilience, and for inferring the implications for conservation management in the face of climate change.;"plant species; climate; biogeographical models";"GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS; VEGETATION DYNAMICS; MODEL; RANGE; ECOSYSTEMS; RESPONSES; GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY";"Biology & Biochemistry; Molecular Biology & Genetics";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology";"[Kramer, Koen; Bijlsma, Rienk-Jan] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Alterra, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Hickler, Thomas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Phys Geog, Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Frankfurt, Germany; [Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France";Kramer, K (reprint author), Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Alterra, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.;"France; Germany; Netherlands";"France; Germany; Netherlands";"DEU; FRA; NLD";1;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES;;;;;8;8;1121;1129;;10.7150/ijbs.4866;1449-2288;;;1449-2288;;oui;1;2012;oui;1;2012;Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553;Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553;UMR5553;UMR5553;3 - Correcte

The study then compares the temperatures measured in cleared and forested sectors within a reserve in the area of Alta Floresta (Mato Grosso, Brazil) between 2006 and 2007. The cleared sector was always hotter and drier (from 5% to 10%) than the forested area.

Earthworms mix and transform nitrogen and carbon without consuming additional energy. The objective of this paper is to analyse whether earthworms modify the emissions of NH3, N2O, CH4 and CO2 during vermifiltration of pig slurry. The experiment used mesocosms of around 50 L, made from a vermifilter treating the diluted manure of a swine house. Three levels of slurry were added to the mesocosms, with or without earthworms, during one month, in triplicate. Earthworm abundance and gas emissions were measured three and five times, respectively. There was a decrease in emissions of ammonia and nitrous oxide and a sink of methane in treatments with earthworms. We suggest that earthworm abundance can be used as a bioindicator of low energy input, and low greenhouse gas and ammonia output in systems using fresh slurry with water recycling.

Parts of North America (NA) have experienced a spring cooling trend over the last three decades, but little is known about the response of vegetation growth to this change. Using observed climate data and satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from 1982 to 2006, we investigated changes in spring (April-May) temperature trends and their impact on vegetation growth in NA. A piecewise linear regression approach shows that the trend in spring temperature is not continuous through the 25-year period. In the northwestern region of NA, spring temperature increased until the late 1980s or early 1990s, and stalled or decreased afterwards. In response, a spring vegetation greening trend, which was evident in this region during the 1980s, stalled or reversed recently. Conversely, an opposite phenomenon occurred in the northeastern region of NA due to different spring temperature trends. Additionally, the trends of summer vegetation growth vary between the periods before and after the turning point (TP) of spring temperature trends. This change cannot be fully explained by summer drought stress change alone and is partly explained by changes in the trends of spring temperature as well as those of summer temperature. As reported in previous studies, summer vegetation browning trends have occurred in the northwestern region of NA since the early 1990s, which is consistent with the spring and summer cooling trends in this region during this period.;;"DROUGHT SEVERITY INDEX; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; SATELLITE DATA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHOTOSYNTHETIC TRENDS; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CARBON-DIOXIDE; FOREST; BOREAL";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Wang, Xuhui; Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ciais, Philippe; Friedlingstein, Pierre] Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Unite Mixte Rech Commissariat Energie Atom, Ctr Natl Rech Sci,CE Orme des Merisiers, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Li, Junsheng] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Friedlingstein, Pierre] Univ Bristol, Quantifying & Understanding Earth Syst QUEST, Dept Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; [Koven, Charlie] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chen, Anping] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA";Piao, SL (reprint author), Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;"France; People's Republic of China; United Kingdom; United States";"France; People's Republic of China; United Kingdom; United States";"CHN; FRA; GBR; USA";106;PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA;;;;;108;4;1240;1245;;10.1073/pnas.1014425108;0027-8424;;;0027-8424;;oui;1;2011;oui;1;2011;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212;UMR8212;UMR8212;5 - Exceptionelle

Estimates of time since divergence support the hypothesis that these islands acted as refugia during the last interglacial maximum.

Observations of plant community change within temperate mountain forest ecosystems in response to recent warming are scarce in comparison to high-elevation alpine and nival ecosystems, perhaps reflecting the confounding influence of forest stand dynamics. Location Jura Mountains (France and Switzerland). Methods We assessed changes in plant community composition by surveying 154 Abies alba forest vegetation releves (550-1,350 m a.s.l.) in 1989 and 2007. Over this period, temperatures increased while precipitation did not change. Correspondence analysis (CA) and ecological indicator values were used to measure changes in plant community composition. Releves in even- and uneven-aged stands were analysed separately to determine the influence of forest stand dynamics. We also analysed changes in species distribution to detect shifts along the elevation gradient by focusing on the lowest, central and highest positions of lowland and mountain species altitudinal ranges. Results We found significant shifts along the first CA axis, which reflected a change in plant community composition towards a greater frequency of lowland species. Analyses of ecological indicator values indicated increases in temperature and light availability in A. alba stands, particularly in even-aged stands. However, no major changes in overall species distribution were found. Conclusions The community-level changes are consistent with effects of climate warming and local stand dynamics. Changes in species distribution were small in comparison to observed local temperature increases, perhaps reflecting dispersal limitation, phenotypic plasticity or microclimatic buffering by the tree canopy. Causality cannot rigorously be inferred from such a descriptive study; however, we suggest that recent warming is now driving plant community change in the climatically more moderate mid-elevation forest setting.";"Biotic impacts; Forest ecosystems; Global warming; Plant community ecology; Range shifts; Species distribution; Vegetation change";"POSTGLACIAL DISPERSAL LIMITATION; SWEDISH OAK FORESTS; LONG-TERM; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; SOIL ACIDIFICATION; ALPINE VEGETATION; LAYER VEGETATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; VASCULAR PLANTS; SWISS ALPS";"Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry";"[Lenoir, J.; Gegout, J.

SOC is also a major potential source of future emissions as conversion of land from pasture or forest to arable land leads to significant emissions of CO(2) plus N(2)O. We have investigated the relationship between UK crop yields, land-use change and GHG emissions. There are a number of potential threats to future yields including climate change, water availability and pest pressure. Were pasture or forested land to be converted to arable land in order to compensate for lower yields then this would result in significant additional GHG emissions from SOC losses. We have modelled the impact of increasing the arable land area in the UK and other selected countries compensating for UK crop yield reductions. The predicted 20-year emissions range from under 5 x 10(6) t CO(2)-e to over 5 x 10(8) t CO(2)-e, following yield reductions of individual UK crops between 5 per cent and 30 per cent.

In Italy, observations were made at Pisa over the years 1657-1658 by V. Viviani and A. Borelli, and at Modena during the year 1694 by B. Ramazzini. These readings have been recovered, corrected and adjusted to modern units. The early instruments used and their problems have been thoroughly discussed. Barometer observations recorded by John Locke in Essex (UK) during the year 1694 have also been recovered and corrected. Daily observations were recorded during the same period in Paris by L. Morin; these have previously been published by Legrand and Le Goff ( 1992: Les observations meteorologiques de Louis Morin. Monographie No. 6, Direction de la Meteorologie Nationale, Ministere de l'Equipement, de Logement et des Transports, 41 pp.). However, cross-comparisons with the Locke and Ramazzini data have shown that the Paris series needed a further correction to take into account instrumental error. Using these three corrected series, it has been possible to reconstruct the atmospheric circulation over Europe for the year 1694. An indication of the state of the atmospheric circulation can also be made by using the earlier observations recorded in Italy. A common feature of the two periods studied (1657-1658 and 1694) is that winters were characterized by higher pressure compared with the reference period 1961-1990, while the summers generally experienced lower pressure. This latter conclusion indicates that the Azores High was late or not well developed, favouring low temperature and frequent rain in the late spring and early summer.";"barometer; circulation indices; climate change; early instruments; environmental history; Maunder Minimum";"DAILY AIR-TEMPERATURE; DAILY MILAN TEMPERATURE; SERIES 1763-1998; RECONSTRUCTION; CIRCULATION; HISTORY";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary";"[Camuffo, Dario] ISAC, CNR, I-35127 Padua, Italy; [Jones, Phil D.; Cornes, Richard] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Garnier, Emmanuel] Univ Caen, F-14032 Caen, France";Camuffo, D (reprint author), ISAC, CNR, Corso Stati Uniti 4, I-35127 Padua, Italy.;"France; Italy; United Kingdom";"France; Italy; United Kingdom";"FRA; GBR; ITA";9;HOLOCENE;;;;;20;3;337;349;;10.1177/0959683609351900;0959-6836;;;0959-6836;;oui;1;2010;non;0;;;;;;3 - Correcte

Historically, these forests have been subjected to ecological impacts and economic losses caused principally by wildfires and, to a lesser but no less significant extent, by the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis (Coleoptera, Curculionidae). According to studies conducted in the United States and beliefs of rural Honduran landowners, a relationship exists between the activity of this insect pest and environmental conditions. To explore this relationship, we developed a model relating periodic southern pine beetle outbreaks and environmental conditions in Honduras. We found that increases in mean ambient temperatures in the month of June, reductions in mean monthly precipitation in June and July, and climatic anomalies in warm months that influence the annual frequency of wildfires were correlated with the occurrence and extent of southern pine beetle outbreaks since 1982. With the small amount of information available and lacking previous studies on the causes of bark beetle outbreaks in Central America, this study provides valuable information on the importance of forest management to address southern pine beetle outbreaks and illustrates a general approach that will help to predict the effects of climate change on pine forests of Honduras.;"outbreaks; pine forests; forest management; climatic anomalies";"COLEOPTERA; SCOLYTIDAE";Plant & Animal Science;Forestry;"[Rivera Rojas, M.] Corp Colombiana Invest Agropecuaria CORPOICA, Estac Expt El Mira, Narino, Colombia; [Locatelli, B.] CIRAD UPR Forest Policies, Montpellier, France; [Locatelli, B.] CIFOR ENV, Bogor, Indonesia; [Billings, R.] Texas Forest Serv, College Stn, TX USA";Rojas, MR (reprint author), Corp Colombiana Invest Agropecuaria CORPOICA, Estac Expt El Mira, Km 38,Via Tumaco Pasto, Narino, Colombia.;"Colombia; France; Indonesia; United States";"Colombia; France; Indonesia; United States";"COL; FRA; IDN; USA";3;FOREST SYSTEMS;;;;;19;1;70;76;;;2171-5068;;;2171-5068;;oui;1;2010;non;0;;;;;;2 - Acceptable

Forests will have to adapt not only to changes in mean climate variables but also to increased variability with greater risk of extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought, storms and floods. Sensitivity, potential impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability to climate change are reviewed for European forests. The most important potential impacts of climate change on forest goods and services are summarized for the Boreal, Temperate Oceanic, Temperate Continental, Mediterranean, and mountainous regions. Especially in northern and western Europe the increasing atmospheric CO2 content and warmer temperatures are expected to result in positive effects on forest growth and wood production, at least in the short-medium term. On the other hand, increasing drought and disturbance risks will cause adverse effects. These negative impacts are very likely to outweigh positive trends in southern and eastern Europe. From west to east, the drought risk increases. In the Mediterranean regions productivity is expected to decline due to strongly increased droughts and fire risks. Adaptive capacity consists of the inherent adaptive capacity of trees and forest ecosystems and of socio-economic factors determining the capability to implement planned adaptation. The adaptive capacity in the forest sector is relatively large in the Boreal and the Temperate Oceanic regions, more constrained by socio-economic factors in the Temperate Continental, and most limited in the Mediterranean region where large forest areas are only extensively managed or unmanaged. Potential impacts and risks are best studied and understood with respect to wood production. It is clear that all other goods and services provided by European forests will also be impacted by climate change, but much less knowledge is available to quantify these impacts. Understanding of adaptive capacity and regional vulnerability to climate change in European forests is not well developed and requires more focussed research efforts. An interdisciplinary research agenda integrated with monitoring networks and projection models is needed to provide information at all levels of decision making, from policy development to the management unit.

Soil macroaggregate (> 250 mu m) content of Ah horizons was strongly depleted (72%) in colder plots affected by freeze-thaw events, compared to 96% in warmer and frost-free plots (p < 0.05). A visual assessment of soil macroaggregation showed that physical processes were the main drivers of soil macroaggregation in colder plots, with 66% of the 5-12.5 mm fraction and the whole 3.15-5 mm fraction. Conversely, we found a balanced contribution of biological and physical aggregation pathways in warmer plots. All identified macroaggregate types could be classified, depending on their organic matter (OM) quality, using principal component analyses of their near infrared spectra. Such spectral classifications indicated temporal changes in OM quality of macroaggregates, from formation to colonization by fine roots, suggesting ecosystem-specific ontogenic trajectories for soil macroaggregation. Further physico-chemical characterizations of soil macroaggregates and Ah horizons showed that soil organic carbon content in the Ah horizon was constant along the gradient, whereas soil erodibility was reduced in warmer soils, which prevented the occurrence of fragile macroaggregates formed by freeze-thaw events. Our study thus suggests changes in the erodibility of mountain forest soils under changing climate.

In its 4-year design, starting from January 2010, the collaborative project for specific cooperation actions (SICA) dedicated to international partner countries shall analyze ongoing and future climate-induced changes in hydrological budgets and extremes across the Mediterranean and neighboring regions. This is undertaken in study sites located in Sardinia, Northern Italy, Southern France, Tunisia, Turkey, Egypt and the Palestinian-administered area Gaza. The work plan is targeted to selected river or aquifer catchments, where the consortium will employ a combination of novel field monitoring and remote sensing concepts, data assimilation, integrated hydrologic modeling and socioeconomic factor analyses to reduce existing uncertainties in climate change impact analysis. Advanced climate scenario analysis will be employed and available ensembles of regional climate model simulations will be downscaled. This process will provide the drivers for an ensemble of hydro(-geo)logical models with different degrees of complexity in terms of process description and level of integration. The results of hydrological modeling and socio-economic factor analysis will enable the development of a GIS-based Vulnerability and Risk Assessment Tool. This tool will serve as a platform for the dissemination of project results, including communication with and planning for local and regional stakeholders. An important output of the research in the individual study sites will be the development of a set of recommendations for an improved monitoring and modeling strategy for climate change impact assessment.

Underlying this trend is a well-understood sequence of development, overexploitation, depletion and in some instances collapse of individual fish stocks, a pattern that can sequentially link geographically distant populations. Ineffective governance, economic considerations and climate impacts are often responsible for this sequence, although the relative contribution of each factor is contentious. In this paper we use a global bioeconomic model to explore the synergistic effects of climate variability, economic pressures and management measures in causing or avoiding this sequence. The model shows how a combination of climate-induced variability in the underlying fish population production, particular patterns of demand for fish products and inadequate management is capable of driving the world's fisheries into development, overexploitation, collapse and recovery phases consistent with observations. Furthermore, it demonstrates how a sequential pattern of overexploitation can emerge as an endogenous property of the interaction between regional environmental fluctuations and a globalized trade system.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of potential adaptation options in forestry in Europe based on three pillars: a review of the scientific literature, an analysis of current national response strategies, and an expert assessment based on a database compiled in the COST Action ECHOES (Expected Climate Change and Options for European Silviculture). The adaptation measures include responses to both risks and opportunities created by climate change and address all stages of forestry operations. Measures targeted to reduce vulnerability to climate change may either aim to reduce forest sensitivity to adverse climate change impacts or increase adaptive capacity to cope with the changing environmental conditions. Adaptation measures mitigating drought and fire risk such as selection of more drought resistant species and genotypes are crucial. For adaptation to be successful it is of the utmost importance to disseminate the knowledge of suitable adaptation measures to all decision makers from the practice to the policy level. The analysis of the ECHOES database demonstrates that this challenge is well recognized in many European countries. Uncertainty about the full extent of climate change impacts and the suitability of adaptation measures creates a need for monitoring and further research. A better understanding of how to increase adaptive capacity is also needed, as well as regional vulnerability assessments which are crucial for targeting planned adaptation measures.;"forestry; Europe; climate change; adaptation strategies; forest management";;Plant & Animal Science;Forestry;"[Kolstrom, Marja; Lindner, Marcus; Vilen, Terhi] EFI, Joensuu 80100, Finland; [Maroschek, Michael; Seidl, Rupert; Lexer, Manfred J.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Silviculture, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Netherer, Sigrid] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Forest Entomol Forest Pathol & Forest Protec, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Kremer, Antoine; Delzon, Sylvain] Univ Bordeaux, INRA, UMR BIOGECO, F-33612 Cestas, France; [Barbati, Anna; Corona, Piermaria] Univ Tuscia, Dept Innovat Biol Agrofood & Forest Syst DIBAF, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Marchetti, Marco] Italian Acad Forest Sci, I-50133 Florence, Italy";Kolstrom, M (reprint author), EFI, Torikatu 34, Joensuu 80100, Finland.;"Austria; Finland; France; Italy";"Austria; Finland; France; Italy";"AUT; FIN; FRA; ITA";35;FORESTS;;;;;2;4;961;982;;10.3390/f2040961;1999-4907;;;1999-4907;;oui;1;2011;non;0;;;;;;3 - Correcte

Recent work has shown that the timing of breeding in wild birds is changing in response to climate change partly because individuals are remarkably flexible in their timing of breeding. Despite this work, our understanding of these processes in wild populations remains very limited and biased towards species from temperate regions. Here, we report the response to changing climate in a tropical wild bird population using a long-term dataset on a formerly critically endangered island endemic, the Mauritius kestrel. We show that the frequency of spring rainfall affects the timing of breeding, with birds breeding later in wetter springs. Delays in breeding have consequences in terms of reduced reproductive success as birds get exposed to risks associated with adverse climatic conditions later on in the breeding season, which reduce nesting success. These results, combined with the fact that frequency of spring rainfall has increased by about 60 per cent in our study area since 1962, imply that climate change is exposing birds to the stochastic risks of late reproduction by causing them to start breeding relatively late in the season.;"breeding phenology; climate change; Mauritius kestrel; tropical island endemic";"BUZZARD BUTEO-BUTEO; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; FALCO-TINNUNCULUS; MAURITIUS KESTREL; COMMON BUZZARD; REPRODUCTION; MIGRATION; SUCCESS; WEATHER";"Biology & Biochemistry; Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";"[Senapathi, Deepa; Nicoll, Malcolm A.

These changes are often the result of climatic or environmental variations and can be manifested in multiple datasets as different responses, but all datasets can have the same changepoint locations/timings. The method we present uses transdimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo to infer probability distributions on the number and locations (in depth or time) of changepoints, the mean values between changepoints and, if required, the noise variance associated with each dataset being considered. This latter point is important as we generally will have limited information on the noise, such as estimates only of measurement uncertainty, and in most cases it is not practical to make repeat sampling/measurement to assess other contributions to the variation in the data. We describe the main features of the approach (and describe the mathematical formulation in supplementary material), and demonstrate its validity using synthetic datasets, with known changepoint structure (number and locations of changepoints) and distribution of noise variance for each dataset We show that when using multiple data, we expect to achieve better resolution of the changepoint structure than when we use each dataset individually. This is conditional on the validity of the assumption of common changepoints between different datasets. We then apply the method to two sets of real geochemical data, both from peat cores, taken from NE Australia and eastem Tibet. Under the assumption that changes occur at the same time for all datasets, we recover solutions consistent with those previously inferred qualitatively from independent data and interpretations. However, our approach provides a quantitative estimate of the relative probability of the inferred changepoints, allowing an objective assessment of the significance of each change.

Elevated CO2 has consistently stimulated forest productivity at the Duke Forest free-air CO2 enrichment experiment throughout the decade-long experiment. It remains unclear how the N cycle has changed with elevated CO2 to support this increased productivity. Using natural-abundance measures of N isotopes together with an ecosystem-scale N-15 tracer experiment, we quantified the cycling of N-15 in plant and soil pools under ambient and elevated CO2 over three growing seasons to determine how elevated CO2 changed N cycling between plants, soil, and microorganisms. After measuring natural-abundance N-15 differences in ambient and CO2-fumigated plots, we applied inorganic N-15 tracers and quantified the redistribution of N-15 for three subsequent growing seasons. The natural abundance of leaf litter was enriched under elevated compared to ambient CO2, consistent with deeper rooting and enhanced N mineralization. After tracer application, N-15 was initially retained in the organic and mineral soil horizons. Recovery of N-15 in plant biomass was 3.5 +/- 0.5% in the canopy, 1.7 +/- 0.2% in roots and 1.7 +/- 0.2% in branches. After two growing seasons, N-15 recoveries in biomass and soil pools were not significantly different between CO2 treatments, despite greater total N uptake under elevated CO2. After the third growing season, N-15 recovery in trees was significantly higher in elevated compared to ambient CO2. Natural-abundance N-15 and tracer results, taken together, suggest that trees growing under elevated CO2 acquired additional soil N resources to support increased plant growth. Our study provides an integrated understanding of elevated CO2 effects on N cycling in the Duke Forest and provides a basis for inferring how C and N cycling in this forest may respond to elevated CO2 beyond the decadal time scale.;"N-15; atmospheric CO2; carbon sequestration; FACE experiment; N cycling; Pinus taeda";"ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; WARM-TEMPERATE FOREST; SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; PROGRESSIVE NITROGEN LIMITATION; FINE-ROOT PRODUCTION; SCRUB-OAK ECOSYSTEM; PINE FOREST; LOBLOLLY-PINE; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Hofmockel, Kirsten S.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Hofmockel, Kirsten S.; McCarthy, Heather R.; Jackson, Robert B.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Gallet-Budynek, Anne] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Gallet-Budynek, Anne] INRA, UMR TCEM 1220, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France; [McCarthy, Heather R.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Currie, William S.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA";Hofmockel, KS (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;"France; United States";"France; United States";"FRA; USA";16;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;17;11;3338;3350;;10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02465.x;1354-1013;;;1354-1013;;oui;1;2011;non;0;;;;;;5 - Exceptionelle

Current decisions on GHG mitigation in animal production, therefore, are hindered by the complexity and uncertainty of the combined effect of GHG mitigation options on climate change and their relation with other aspects of sustainability.

Examples of these extremes are rainstorms and related phenomena due to rainfall aggressiveness. They produce high-impact land processes such as soil erosion and nutrient losses. Economic and social consequences of these processes can be quite severe. However, hydrological extremes and their environmental implications are still poorly understood, particularly if analyzed in the context of climate change. Here, we analyze a 300 year long times series of historical rainfall patterns across the Mediterranean in the last three centuries and we investigate changes in the erosive forcing as related to climate changes. Our results show that the erosive forcing increased towards the end of the Little Ice Age (similar to 1850) over western and central Mediterranean and that has been increasing in the recent warming period at low Mediterranean latitudes, due to a higher frequency of intensive storms. Such increased concentrated precipitation may lead to an intensification of land degradation processes triggered by soil erosion and transport across a range of scales from hillslopes to small catchments.;;"EROSION; PRECIPITATION; STORM; RIVER";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Romano, Nunzio; Chirico, Giovanni Battista] Univ Naples Federico 2, Dept Agr Engn, I-80055 Naples, Italy; [Diodato, Nazzareno; Bellocchi, Gianni] CEOP GEWEX Network World Climate Res Programme, Met European Res Observ, I-82100 Benevento, Italy; [Bellocchi, Gianni] French Natl Inst Agr Res, Grassland Ecosyst Res Unit, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France";Chirico, GB (reprint author), Univ Naples Federico 2, Dept Agr Engn, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Naples, Italy.;"France; Italy";"France; Italy";"FRA; ITA";11;CLIMATIC CHANGE;;;;;108;3;591;599;;10.1007/s10584-011-0216-4;0165-0009;;;0165-0009;;oui;1;2011;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

Among the 15 most common species, 11 displayed a positive difference between current and past mean latitudes suggesting a northward shift of the populations. Using the occurrence of subtropical species in temperate areas as an indicator of water warming, the northernmost range limit of 10 subtropical species was subsequently focused on. Six of them were recorded up to their past northern latitudinal limit. These results reinforced the idea that a number of fish species associated to estuaries have migrated northwards over the last 30 years, possibly due to water warming.

Mitigation and adaptation present two fundamentally dissimilar approaches whose differences are now well documented. Forest ecosystems play an important role in both adaptation and mitigation and there is a need to explore the linkages between these two options in order to understand their trade-offs and synergies. In forests, potential trade-offs can be observed between global ecosystem services, such as the carbon sequestration relevant for mitigation, and the local ecosystem services that are relevant for adaptation. In addition, mitigation projects can facilitate or hinder the adaptation of local people to climate change, whereas adaptation projects can affect ecosystems and their potential to sequester carbon. Linkages between adaptation and mitigation can also be observed in policies, but few climate change or forest policies have addressed these linkages in the forestry sector. This paper presents examples of linkages between adaptation and mitigation in Latin American forests. Through case studies, we investigate the approaches and reasons for integrating adaptation into mitigation projects or mitigation into adaptation projects.

The questionnaires provided both country and EZ specific information on the: (1) main vulnerabilities of crops and cropping systems under present climate; (2) estimates of climate change impacts on the production of nine selected crops; (3) possible adaptation options as well as (4) adaptation observed so far. In addition we focused on the overall awareness and presence of warning and decision support systems with relevance for adaptation to climate change. The results show that farmers across Europe are currently adapting to climate change, in particular in terms of changing timing of cultivation and selecting other crop species and cultivars. The responses in the questionnaires show a surprisingly high proportion of negative expectations concerning the impacts of climate change on crops and crop production throughout Europe, even in the cool temperate northern European countries. The expected impacts, both positive and negative, are just as large in northern Europe as in the Mediterranean countries, and this is largely linked with the possibilities for effective adaptation to maintain current yields. The most negative effects were found for the continental climate in the Pannonian zone, which includes Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania. This region will suffer from increased incidents of heat waves and droughts without possibilities for effectively shifting crop cultivation to other parts of the years. A wide range of adaptation options exists in most European regions to mitigate many of the negative impacts of climate change on crop production in Europe. However, considering all effects of climate change and possibilties for adaptation, impacts are still mostly negative in wide regions across Europe. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

They are illustrated by seven well-dated records, lakes Accesa, Mezzano, Vico, and Pergusa in Italy, Maliq, Voulkaria and Malo J. in the Balkans. A good tool for disentangling climate change and human impact is the combined interpretation of pollen percentage and concentration/influx data. Pollen concentration/influx drops are an indication of increased erosion in the catchment, mainly ascribable to forest reduction. There is no doubt that major synchronous changes could not have been caused by humans alone. Many southern European records show substantial differences between early- and late-Holocene vegetation, suggesting a general evolution from wetter to drier climatic conditions, in agreement with arid phases recognised by other, independent palaeoclimatic methods. Other pollen records show a different trend. The role of changing seasonality seems important for this region of the Mediterranean. Precipitation seasonality increased during the early to mid Holocene with winter precipitation attaining a maximum, and summer precipitation a minimum. At least three rapid climate events with changes in plant biomass are in evidence: an abrupt and short change around 8200 yr BP, another one centred around 6000 yr BP, and one soon after 3000 yr BP. From the beginning of the Bronze Age (c. 4400 yr BP in this region) human impact overlapped with a climate change, probably bipartite, towards dryness. Our results show that this aridification trend began around 8000 yr BP, and culminated around 4000 yr BP.;"central Mediterranean; climate change; Holocene; human impact; mid-Holocene changes; pollen";"LAGO-DELLACCESA TUSCANY; HOLOCENE POLLEN STRATIGRAPHY; DI-MASSACIUCCOLI TUSCANY; LAKE-LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS; CENTRAL ADRIATIC SEA; CLIMATIC CHANGES; HUMAN IMPACT; PALYNOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY; NEOLITHIC TRANSITION";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary";"[Sadori, Laura] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Biol Ambientale, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Jahns, S.] Brandenburg Landesamt Denkmalpflege & Archaol Lan, Brandenburg, Germany; [Peyron, O.] Univ Franche Comte, F-25030 Besancon, France";Sadori, L (reprint author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Biol Ambientale, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.;"France; Germany; Italy";"France; Germany; Italy";"DEU; FRA; ITA";65;HOLOCENE;;;;;21;1;117;129;;10.1177/0959683610377530;0959-6836;;;0959-6836;;oui;1;2011;non;0;;;;;;3 - Correcte

Rainfall interception, transpiration, runoff and soil water content were monitored during 3 years. Runoff was lower in AFS than MC (5.4 and 8.4% of total rainfall, respectively) and a higher water infiltration was observed under AFS. Still, the higher combined rainfall interception + transpiration of coffee and shade trees in AFS resulted in a lower drainage than in MC. No coffee water stress was recorded either in AFS or MC as relative extractable soil water remained above 20% during the dry seasons. Time course of soil water content showed enhanced access to soil water between 100 and 200 cm depth in AFS. This suggests complementarity for soil water between coffee and shade trees. The model HYDRUS 1D predicted that drainage at 200 cm depth accounted for a large fraction of annual rainfall (68% for MC and 62% for AFS). Climatic scenario simulations showed (1) a potential competition for water between coffee and shade trees when the dry season was extended by 4-6 weeks compared to actual, and (2) a severe reduction in annual drainage, but without competition for water when rainfall was reduced down to 40% of the actual.

It is therefore important for water management authorities to assess the manner in which cyanobacteria may evolve under climate change, especially in the Alpine Region where warming is projected by climate models to be More important than the global average. In this study, air temperature extremes under current climate were used as a proxy for future average climate forced by enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations. The impacts of extreme temperature events on cyanobacteria were analyzed in five deep pen-Alpine lakes, covering the entire trophic gradient and using a synoptic approach. Extreme air temperatures were observed to alter the biomass of the cyanobacteria community. In general, extreme hot events are associated with high biomass while extreme cold events are characterised by low biomass. However, the assessed air temperature extremes did not lead to a dominance of cyanobacteria over the other phytoplankton groups, which also showed responses in relative biomass change during extreme events. Both extreme hot and extreme cold events were seen to generate a loss of diversity among cyanobacteria. In addition, the use of extreme events as a proxy to average future climates is a useful approach to enhance possible impacts of Attire global warming on the biota in freshwater systems. The outcomes of a synoptic approach provide general responses and are a useful tool for further modelling purposes.;"climate change; biodiversity; phytoplankton; meteorological forcing; synoptic study";"CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALGAL BLOOMS; WATER; PHYTOPLANKTON; BIODIVERSITY; SWITZERLAND; COMMUNITY; DYNAMICS; EVENTS; TOXINS";"Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";Limnology;"[Gallina, Nicole; Beniston, Martin] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci ISE, Climate Change & Climate Impacts Res Grp, CH-1227 Carouge, Switzerland; [Anneville, Orlane] INRA, UMR CARRTEL, Stn Hydrobiol Lacustre, F-4203 Thonon Les Bains, France";Gallina, N (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci ISE, Climate Change & Climate Impacts Res Grp, 7 Rte Drize, CH-1227 Carouge, Switzerland.;"France; Switzerland";"France; Switzerland";"CHE; FRA";13;JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY;;;;;70;2;186;196;;10.3274/JL11-70-2-04;1129-5767;1723-8633;;1129-5767 eISSN: 1723-8633;;oui;1;2011;non;0;;;;;;3 - Correcte

Local studies of distributions along elevational gradients reveal small-scale patterns but do not allow generalizations among geographic regions or taxa. We critically assessed data from 249 studies of species elevational distributions in the American, African, and Asia-Pacific tropics. Of these, 150 had sufficient data quality, sampling intensity, elevational range, and freedom from serious habitat disturbance to permit robust across-study comparisons. We found four main patterns: (1) species classified as elevational specialists (upper- or lower-zone specialists) are relatively more frequent in the American than Asia-Pacific tropics, with African tropics being intermediate; (2) elevational specialists are rare on islands, especially oceanic and smaller continental islands, largely due to a paucity of upper-zone specialists; (3) a relatively high proportion of plants and ectothermic vertebrates (amphibians and reptiles) are upper-zone specialists; and (4) relatively few endothermic vertebrates (birds and mammals) are upper-zone specialists. Understanding these broad-scale trends will help identify taxa and geographic regions vulnerable to global warming and highlight future research priorities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Equilibrium assumptions common in many modelling approaches need to be replaced by formulations that allow for changing baselines and integration of ongoing changes and adaptations by species, ecosystems and humans. As ecosystems change, so will the ways humans use, monitor and manage them. Consequently, adaptive management loops and supporting tools deserve more prominence in the management toolbox. Models are critical tools for providing an early understanding of the challenges to be faced by integrating observations and examining possible solutions. We review modelling tools currently available to incorporate the effect of climate change on marine and freshwater ecosystems, and the implications for management of natural resources. System non-linearity can confound interpretations and hence adaptive management responses are needed that are robust to unexpected outcomes. An improvement in the ability to model the effects of climate change from a social and economic perspective is necessary. The outputs from 'end-to-end' and socio-ecological models can potentially inform planning, in both Australia and the Pacific region, about how best to build resilience to climate change. In this context, the importance of well directed data-collection programs is also emphasised. Lessons from this region, which is advanced with regard to modelling approaches, can guide increased use of models to test options for managing aquatic resources worldwide.;"adaptive management; Australian fisheries; ecosystem models; end-to-end models; Pacific Island countries and territories; qualitative models; socioeconomics";"GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; QUALITATIVE RISK-ASSESSMENT; FISHING EFFECTS SAFE; NEW-SOUTH-WALES; TO-END MODELS; FISHERIES-MANAGEMENT; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; TRAWL FISHERY; SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Plant & Animal Science";"Fisheries; Limnology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography";"[Plaganyi, Eva E.; Bustamante, Rodrigo H.; Dennis, Darren M.; Dichmont, Cathy M.; Dutra, Leo X.

Altimeters and gravity missions such as GRACE are used to measure sea level rise at global and regional scales. A variety of satellite sensors (microwave and visible radiometers, scatterometers, SAR, gravity sensors, altimeters, etc.) are used for tracking the melting of sea ice and continental ice over the Polar Regions and Greenland. Satellite techniques are used to monitor large scale natural climate oscillations such as El Nino and the influence of atmospheric teleconexions such as NAO.

Recognizing this role of ecosystems, several international and nongovernmental organizations have promoted an ecosystem-based approach to adaptation. We review the scientific literature related to ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) with forests and trees, and highlight five cases in which forests and trees can support adaptation: (1) forests and trees providing goods to local communities facing climatic threats; (2) trees in agricultural fields regulating water, soil, and microclimate for more resilient production; (3) forested watersheds regulating water and protecting soils for reduced climate impacts; (4) forests protecting coastal areas from climate-related threats; and (5) urban forests and trees regulating temperature and water for resilient cities. The literature provides evidence that EBA with forests and trees can reduce social vulnerability to climate hazards; however, uncertainties and knowledge gaps remain, particularly for regulating services in watersheds and coastal areas. Few studies have been undertaken on EBA specifically, but the abundant literature on ecosystem services can be used to fill knowledge gaps. Many studies assess the multiple benefits of ecosystems for human adaptation or well-being, but also recognize trade-offs between ecosystem services. Better understanding is needed of the efficiency, costs, and benefits, and trade-offs of EBA with forests and trees.

The cost of the substitute is assumed to decrease with cumulative use because of learning-by-doing. We show that optimal energy prices may initially increase because of pollution regulation, but fall due to learning, and rise again because of scarcity of the resource, finally falling after transition to the clean substitute. Thus nonrenewable resource prices may exhibit cyclical behavior even in a purely deterministic setting. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Four stylized burden-sharing rules are considered, ranging from GDP-based permit allocations to schemes that foresee a long-term convergence of per-capita emission permits. The comparison of results from three structurally different hybrid, integrated energy-economy models allows us to derive robust insights as well as identify sources of uncertainty with respect to the regional distribution of the costs of climate change mitigation. We find that regional costs of climate change mitigation may deviate substantially from the global mean. For all models, the mitigation cost average of the four scenarios is higher for China than for the other macro-regions considered. Furthermore, China suffers above-world-average mitigation costs for most burden-sharing rules in the long-term. A decomposition of mitigation costs into (a) primary (domestic) abatement costs and (b) permit trade effects, reveals that the large uncertainty about the future development of carbon prices results in substantial uncertainties about the financial transfers associated with carbon trade for a given allocation scheme. This variation also implies large uncertainty about the regional distribution of climate policy costs.;;"CLIMATE POLICY; REMIND-R; TARGETS; EQUITY";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Luderer, Gunnar; Leimbach, Marian; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [DeCian, Enrica] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Venice, Italy; [Hourcade, Jean-Charles; Waisman, Henri] Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, Paris, France";Luderer, G (reprint author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.;"France; Germany; Italy";"France; Germany; Italy";"DEU; FRA; ITA";8;CLIMATIC CHANGE;;;;;114;1;59;78;;10.1007/s10584-012-0408-6;0165-0009;;;0165-0009;;oui;1;2012;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

Mediaeval glass is subject to the superficial leaching of K and Ca ions leading to the formation of a hydrated silica-gel layer. Both types of glass develop a superficial stratum of deposited atmospheric particles cemented by crystals of gypsum (and syngenite in the case of Si-Ca-K glass), leading to an impairment of the optical properties: decrease of transparency and increase of haze. Dose-response functions established for the two types of glass reveal that haze depends only on pollution parameters (PM, SO2, NO2), while leaching depends both on pollution and climate parameters (RH, T, SO2, NO2). Instrumental records are available for temperature in Paris from 1800. Air pollution in Paris was estimated from statistics of fuel use from 1875 to 1943, measurements that started in the 1950s and projections across the 21st century. The estimated annual rate of haze development indicates a gradual rise from the 16th century. The increasing importance of coal as a fuel through the 19th century and enhanced sulphur dioxide concentration make a rapid increase in haze formation, which reaches a peak about 1950. The likely damage to mediaeval glass follows a rather similar pattern. The period of damage from aggressive pollutants looks later and for a briefer time in Paris than in London.

Over the next two decades, CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS) demonstration projects would need to increase several orders of magnitude across the globe in both size and scale. This task has several potential barriers which will have to be accounted for. These barriers include those that have been known for a number of years including safety of subsurface sequestration, pore-space competition with emerging activities like shale gas production, legal and regulatory frameworks, and public acceptance and technical communication. In addition water management is a new challenge that should be actively and carefully considered across all CCS operations. A review of the new insights gained on these previously and newly identified challenges, since the IPCC special report on CCS, is presented in this paper. While somewhat daunting in scope, some of these challenges can be addressed more easily by recognizing the potential advantageous synergies that can be exploited when these challenges are dealt with in combination. For example, active management of water resources, including brine in deep subsurface formations, can provide the additional cooling-water required by the CO2 capture retrofitting process while simultaneously reducing sequestration leakage risk and furthering efforts toward public acceptance. This comprehensive assessment indicates that water, sequestration, legal, and public acceptance challenges ought to be researched individually, but must also be examined collectively to exploit the promising synergies identified herein. Exploitation of these synergies provides the best possibilities for successful large-scale implementation of CCS.;"CO2 capture and sequestration; Implementation barriers; Synergies; Legal and regulatory; Public acceptance; Water management; Brine production; Pressure management; Pore space competition; Area of review; Risk mitigation";"CARBON CAPTURE; GEOLOGICAL STORAGE; UNITED-STATES; REGULATORY CHALLENGES; SALINE FORMATIONS; UTSIRA FORMATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LEAKAGE; INJECTION; PRESSURE";Environment/Ecology;Environmental Sciences;"[Court, Benjamin; Elliot, Thomas R.; Celia, Michael A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Dammel, Joseph] Univ Minnesota, Humphrey Inst Publ Affairs, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Buscheck, Thomas A.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Rohmer, Jeremy] Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, F-45060 Orleans 2, France";Court, B (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E223 Equad, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;"France; United States";"France; United States";"FRA; USA";4;MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE;;;;;17;6;569;599;;10.1007/s11027-011-9314-x;1381-2386;;;1381-2386;;oui;1;2012;non;0;;;;;;3 - Correcte

The fund received a total of 106 proposals, of which 27 were successful at obtaining financial support. Our aims were to test which factors influenced the funding decision and to discover whether or not and to what extent the fund met its intended objectives through the allocation of monies. The allocation process and its outcomes were analysed using correlation, logistical and linear regression to test our research hypotheses. Using this research funding process as a single study, we found that trying to clear the impact-innovation double hurdle in a single funding initiative ultimately compromises both goals. This paper therefore contributes to our understanding of innovation management within the context of carbon emission reduction and explains which factors influenced success in securing research monies through the funding process.

Among these models a warming trend is universal, but projected changes in precipitation vary in sign and magnitude. Two independent methods are applied: a dynamic global vegetation model to assess changes in plant functional types and bioclimatic envelope modeling to assess changes in individual tree and shrub species and biodiversity. The former approach investigates broad responses of plant functional types to climate change, while considering competition, disturbances, and carbon fertilization, while the latter approach focuses on the response of individual plant species, and net biodiversity, to climate change. The dynamic model simulates a region-wide reduction in vegetation cover during the 21st century, with a partial replacement of evergreen trees with grasses in the mountains of Colorado and Utah, except at the highest elevations, where tree cover increases. Across southern Arizona, central New Mexico, and eastern Colorado, grass cover declines, in some cases abruptly. Due to the prevalent warming trend among all 17 climate models, vegetation cover declines in the 21st century, with the greatest vegetation losses associated with models that project a drying trend. The inclusion of the carbon fertilization effect largely ameliorates the projected vegetation loss. Based on bioclimatic envelope modeling for the 21st century, the number of tree and shrub species that are expected to experience robust declines in range likely outweighs the number of species that are expected to expand in range. Dramatic shifts in plant species richness are projected, with declines in the high-elevation evergreen forests, increases in the eastern New Mexico prairies, and a northward shift of the Sonoran Desert biodiversity maximum.;"bioclimatic envelope model; biodiversity; climate change; dynamic global vegetation model; Southwest United States";"WESTERN UNITED-STATES; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTH-AMERICA; TERRESTRIAL BIOSPHERE; SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; SUMMER PRECIPITATION; MIGRATION CAPACITY; WATER AVAILABILITY; ROCKY-MOUNTAINS";Environment/Ecology;"Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Notaro, Michael; Williams, John W.] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst, Ctr Climat Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Mauss, Adrien] Ecole Natl Meteorol, F-31057 Toulouse 1, France; [Williams, John W.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, Madison, WI 53706 USA";Notaro, M (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst, Ctr Climat Res, 1225 W Dayton St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;"France; United States";"France; United States";"FRA; USA";17;ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS;;;;;22;4;1365;1388;;;1051-0761;;;1051-0761;;oui;1;2012;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

We present a new statistical reconstruction of annual temperature variability back to 1901 for the Pyramid Automated Weather Station of the Ev-K2-CNR Committee, located at the base of the Mount Everest. Our reconstruction using recorded weather station data compared with the Climate Research Unit temperature pattern data indicate that in recent decades the warming trend over the H/TP has been faster than during any equivalent period in the last century. Positive temperature anomalies (mostly observed after 1970) were found to be correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the Pacifical Decadal Oscillation indices, but unevenly correlated with the Northern Hemisphere (NH) land-surface temperature. Such decoupled response between H/TP and NH suggests the mechanisms of global warming are only marginally influencing the H/TP climate.

A newly developed numerical analysis disentangles the climatic and anthropogenic influences on vegetation and reveals for the first time for southwest Turkey the timing and influence of late-Holocene climate change. Results show that sudden vegetation changes, driven by changes in moisture availability, co-occurred with well-defined European climate shifts. A trend towards dry conditions, from c. AD 640 to 940, coincides with the cold early Middle Ages in Europe. During this period, human presence in the region diminished and agricultural activity switched focus from crop cultivation to pastoralism while signs of cereal cultivation temporarily ceased. This period was followed by a return to moister conditions from AD 940 to 1280, coinciding with the 'Medieval Climate Anomaly'. During this period there was a resurgence of human activity in the basin. Another trend towards dry conditions occurred at c. AD 1280, corresponding with the start of the 'Little Ice Age' in Europe and another disappearance of cereal pollen until the present day.

Bluetongue (BT), a recently emerged arboviral disease of ruminants in Europe, is often cited as an illustration of climate's impact on disease emergence, although no study has yet tested this association. Here, we develop a framework to quantitatively evaluate the effects of climate on BT's emergence in Europe by integrating high-resolution climate observations and model simulations within a mechanistic model of BT transmission risk. We demonstrate that a climate-driven model explains, in both space and time, many aspects of BT's recent emergence and spread, including the 2006 BT outbreak in northwest Europe which occurred in the year of highest projected risk since at least 1960. Furthermore, the model provides mechanistic insight into BT's emergence, suggesting that the drivers of emergence across Europe differ between the South and the North. Driven by simulated future climate from an ensemble of 11 regional climate models, the model projects increase in the future risk of BT emergence across most of Europe with uncertainty in rate but not in trend. The framework described here is adaptable and applicable to other diseases, where the link between climate and disease transmission risk can be quantified, permitting the evaluation of scale and uncertainty in climate change's impact on the future of such diseases.;"climate change; vector-borne disease transmission; basic reproductive ratio; emergence; bluetongue; Culicoides";"CULICOIDES-SONORENSIS DIPTERA; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DAIRY; AFRICAN HORSE SICKNESS; VIRUS TRANSMISSION; NORTHERN EUROPE; SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION; SEROTYPE-8 EPIDEMIC; FIELD OBSERVATIONS; SATELLITE IMAGERY; OBSOLETUS COMPLEX";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Guis, Helene; Baylis, Matthew] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Univ Climate & Infect Dis Anim Lucinda, Fac Vet Sci, Neston CH64 7TE, England; [Guis, Helene; Tran, Annelise] UPR AGIRS, CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Guis, Helene] UMR CMAEE, CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Caminade, Cyril; Morse, Andrew P.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZT, Merseyside, England; [Calvete, Carlos] CITA, Unidad Sanidad & Prod Anim, Zaragoza, Spain; [Tran, Annelise] UMR TETIS, CIRAD, F-34093 Montpellier, France";Baylis, M (reprint author), Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Univ Climate & Infect Dis Anim Lucinda, Fac Vet Sci, Leahurst Campus, Neston CH64 7TE, England.;"France; Spain; United Kingdom";"France; Spain; United Kingdom";"ESP; FRA; GBR";33;JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE;;;;;9;67;339;350;;10.1098/rsif.2011.0255;1742-5689;;;1742-5689;;oui;1;2012;non;0;;;;;;5 - Exceptionelle

In principle, auctions are superior from the viewpoints of efficiency, fairness, transparency, and simplicity. In practice, auctions have been opposed by important sectors of industry, which argue that carbon pricing without compensation would harm international competitiveness. In the European Union's Emissions Trading System, this concern led to grandfathering that is updated at various intervals. Unfortunately, updating gives industry an incentive to change behavior to influence future allocation. Furthermore, the wealth transferred to incumbent firms can be significantly larger than the extra costs incurred, leading to windfall profits. Meanwhile, potential auction revenues are not available to reduce other taxes. By circumscribing free allocation, benchmarking can target competitiveness concerns, incur less wealth transfer, and provide a strategy consistent with transitioning to auctions in the long run.;"Benchmarking; Emissions trading; Allocation of allowances; EU ETS";"POLLUTION-CONTROL; INCENTIVES; SECTOR";"Engineering; Environment/Ecology";"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences";"[Zetterberg, Lars] IVL Swedish Environm Res Inst, S-10031 Stockholm, Sweden; [Wrake, Markus] Int Energy Agcy, F-75239 Paris, France; [Sterner, Thomas] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Fischer, Carolyn; Burtraw, Dallas] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA";Zetterberg, L (reprint author), IVL Swedish Environm Res Inst, Box 210 60, S-10031 Stockholm, Sweden.;"France; Sweden; United States";"France; Sweden; United States";"FRA; SWE; USA";7;AMBIO;;;;;41;;23;32;;10.1007/s13280-011-0238-1;0044-7447;;;0044-7447;;oui;1;2012;non;0;;;;;;3 - Correcte

Experimental drought caused strong reductions in ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem CO2 exchange, but ecosystem fluxes recovered rapidly following rewetting irrespective of N and species diversity. As expected, root C stocks and litter decomposition were adversely affected by drought across all N and plant diversity treatments. In contrast, drought increased soil water retention, organic nutrient leaching losses and soil fertility. Drought responses of above-ground vegetation C stocks varied depending on plant diversity, with greater stability of above-ground vegetation C to drought in the high versus low diversity treatment. This positive effect of high plant diversity on above-ground vegetation C stability coincided with a decrease in the stability of microbial biomass C. Unlike species diversity, soil N availability had limited effects on the stability of ecosystem processes to extreme drought. Overall, our findings indicate that extreme drought events promote post-drought soil nutrient retention and soil fertility, with cascading effects on ecosystem C fixation rates. Data on above-ground ecosystem processes underline the importance of species diversity for grassland function in a changing environment. Furthermore, our results suggest that plant-soil interactions play a key role for the short-term stability of above-ground vegetation C storage to extreme drought events. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

By August 2010, 44 least developed countries had prepared their NAPAs in response to climate change. The NAPAs constitute a starting point for planning adaptation nationally and sub-nationally, but need to be evaluated and improved as new knowledge emerges. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is an emerging approach that recognizes that ecosystem services play an important role in reducing people's vulnerability to climate change. The importance of ecosystem services is acknowledged in more than 50% of the NAPAs. Approximately 22% of the proposed projects include ecosystem activities for social well-being or adaptation, with most of them in support of other adaptation measures (e.g. infrastructure). These projects deal mainly with regulating services (soil rehabilitation, erosion control and water regulation) and provisioning services (food, fibre and fuel wood). They also have the potential to promote integrative and cross-sectoral adaptation, as many of them consider multiple ecosystem services and beneficiary sectors. However, more technical, political and financial support is needed to foster the role of ecosystem services in adaptation.;"adaptation; ecosystem-based adaptation; ecosystem services; least-developed countries; National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs)";"ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE; ECONOMIC VALUATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; BIODIVERSITY";"Environment/Ecology; Social Sciences";"Environmental Studies; Public Administration";"[Pramova, Emilia; Brockhaus, Maria] Jalan CIFOR, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Situ Gede 16115, Bogor Barat, Indonesia; [Pramova, Emilia; Locatelli, Bruno; Fohlmeister, Sandra] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Locatelli, Bruno] Agr Res Ctr Int Dev CIRAD, TA 178 04, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France";Pramova, E (reprint author), Jalan CIFOR, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Situ Gede 16115, Bogor Barat, Indonesia.;"France; Germany; Indonesia";"France; Germany; Indonesia";"DEU; FRA; IDN";4;CLIMATE POLICY;;;;;12;4;393;409;;10.1080/14693062.2011.647848;1469-3062;;;1469-3062;;oui;1;2012;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

Environmental impact assessments (EIA) are particularly relevant in this context. This analysis identifies potential entry points for employing EIA as a vehicle for enhancing the resilience of projects to climate change impacts. It also documents progress in this direction by developed and developing countries. Several governments have signalled their intent to move in this direction; this assessment could find examples in only two countries of projects that considered climate change impacts and adaptation in EIA. A key bottleneck is the lack of availability of detailed historical and future climate information.

Over the previous decade, the only food legumes to have shown significant production increases have been chickpea, lentil and faba bean in North America, chickpea in Australia, and faba bean in Europe. In smallholder farming in developing countries, production trends have mostly been static or have declined over the past decade despite the existence of technology that should permit higher and more stable yields. Ability to reverse negative trends is jeopardized by climate change as food legumes are mostly grown rainfed and are being exposed to increasingly variable and extreme weather. This review examines recent innovations in cultivation technology for the major food legumes-chickpea, lentil, dry pea, faba bean, lupin, common bean, mung bean, black gram, cowpea, and pigeonpea-and explores constraints to their adoption, particularly by resource-poor smallholder farmers. Conservation agriculture, involving minimum soil disturbance, maximum soil cover, and diverse rotations, has contributed to sustainable cropping system production in large-scale commercial farming systems in the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Turkey. Temperate food legumes have been incorporated into such systems. Adoption of conservation agriculture is only just beginning for smallholder farming in Asia and Africa, catalyzed by the development of low-cost implements suitable for minimum tillage. Water use efficiency improves with conservation agriculture as it allows for earlier planting, reduced soil evaporation, better weed management, and increased access to nutrients. Ecosystem-based approaches to plant nutrition are evolving which place more reliance on accessing organic and mineral reservoirs than in replenishing the immediately available pool with chemical fertilizers, leading to enhanced nutrient use efficiency of cropping systems. Ecosystem-based approaches are also being applied to management of weeds, diseases, and insect pests of food legumes, again with decreased reliance on synthetic chemicals. In achieving sustainable agricultural production systems, there is increasing realization of the need to move towards the tenets of organic agriculture, as exemplified in conservation agriculture and ecosystem-based approaches to plant nutrition and pest management. This does not necessarily imply a desire to qualify for organic product certification but more a realization of the need for sustainable agriculture. The movement towards conservation and organic agriculture encourages greater inclusion of food legumes, and legumes generally, in cropping systems. Unfortunately, however, technology transfer to resource-poor farming situations, where most food legumes are produced, remains a major bottleneck to meeting global demand. More participatory approaches to technology development, testing, and dissemination are required than hitherto practiced. It is suggested that this process could be enhanced by better focusing on major constraints within the value addition chain for food legumes.;"Legume area trends; Climate change; Conservation agriculture; Smallholder farming; Water use efficiency; Nutrient use efficiency; Weeds; Integrated disease management; Integrated crop management";"WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; MEDITERRANEAN-TYPE ENVIRONMENTS; CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; NORTHERN GREAT-PLAINS; LENTIL LENS-CULINARIS; ARACHIS-HYPOGAEA L.; BLIGHT ASCOCHYTA-RABIEI; RAINFALL-USE EFFICIENCY; SEASON GRAIN LEGUMES; CICER-ARIETINUM L.";Agricultural Sciences;Agronomy;"[Siddique, Kadambot H.

It affects food and nutrition security and undermines current efforts to reduce hunger and promote nutrition. Undernutrition in turn undermines climate resilience and the coping strategies of vulnerable populations. Objectives: The objectives of this paper are to identify and undertake a cross-sectoral analysis of the impacts of climate change on nutrition security and the existing mechanisms, strategies, and policies to address them. Methods: A cross-sectoral analysis of the impacts of climate change on nutrition security and the mechanisms and policies to address them was guided by an analytical framework focused on the three 'underlying causes' of undernutrition: 1) household food access, 2) maternal and child care and feeding practices, 3) environmental health and health access. The analytical framework includes the interactions of the three underlying causes of undernutrition with climate change,vulnerability, adaptation and mitigation. Results: Within broad efforts on climate change mitigation and adaptation and climate-resilient development, a combination of nutrition-sensitive adaptation and mitigation measures, climate-resilient and nutrition-sensitive agricultural development, social protection, improved maternal and child care and health, nutrition-sensitive risk reduction and management, community development measures, nutrition-smart investments, increased policy coherence, and institutional and cross-sectoral collaboration are proposed as a means to address the impacts of climate change to food and nutrition security. This paper proposes policy directions to address nutrition in the climate change agenda and recommendations for consideration by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Conclusions: Nutrition and health stakeholders need to be engaged in key climate change adaptation and mitigation initiatives, including science-based assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and policies and actions formulated by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Improved multi-sectoral coordination and political will is required to integrate nutrition-sensitive actions into climate-resilient sustainable development efforts in the UNFCCC work and in the post 2015 development agenda. Placing human rights at the center of strategies to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change and international solidarity is essential to advance sustainable development and to create a climate for nutrition security.;"Adaptation; agriculture; climate change; diets; food security; health; nutrition; mitigation; undernutrition; sustainable; risk reduction";"CHILD UNDERNUTRITION; PROTEIN-CONCENTRATION; FOOD; HEALTH; CO2";"Agricultural Sciences; Clinical Medicine";"Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics";"[Tirado, M.

The calculations are aimed at identifying the mineralogical transformations likely occurring in the cement during the working life and after the closure of the wells present in the area, before the injection of CO2. Field evidence, experimental data, and previous numerical simulations have been used to constrain the initial geochemical conditions and the hydraulic parameters of the model. Significant mineralogical transformations in the cement (portlandite and katoite dissolution, CSH, ettringite, hydrotalcite precipitation), and minor modifications of the initial clayrock mineralogical assemblage (quartz, montmorillonite and illite dissolution, and precipitation of cement-like phases) are predicted at the caprock-cement interface. Associated with these mineralogical transformations, measurable variations in porosity are also computed. Although Portland cement is predicted to retain its integrity at some distance from the interface, calculations confirm the general view that material alteration at the interfaces is of major concern for the minimization of the risks of CO2 leakage from storage zones. Numerical outputs are sensitive with respect to poorly constrained physical and transport parameters, such as the spatial distribution of interconnected porosity in the cement. Different degrees of portlandite dissolution/carbonate precipitation can be predicted during in situ ageing under conditions similar to the Paris Basin, depending on the adopted gridding scheme, i.e. on the conceptualization of the cement as a homogeneous or dual-porosity medium.

In this study, we employ a 1-D stratification model and a 9 year forcing data set to simulate the thermal dynamics in a large, but shallow reservoir that regularly displays a polymictic character with complete mixing events during summer. Such mixing dynamics is typical for many water bodies in the temperate zone having an intermediate depth. In many cases summer-mixing events were documented to induce severe water quality deteriorations (e.g., cyanobacterial blooms). We examined and quantified the response of summer-mixing behavior to combinations of hydrological regimes, i.e., water level fluctuations and withdrawal depth, and changes in meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature and wind speed. According to our findings: (i) increasing summer air temperatures considerably increase the resistance of the water column against mixing; (ii) while the combination of maintenance of a high and constant water depth and implementation of epilimnetic discharge results in almost complete resistance to mixing, their individual effects are also substantial, being roughly comparable to the effects of 4-6 K increase in air temperatures; (iii) wind is a critical variable, 30% increase of which can compensate up to 5.5 K increase in air temperatures; and (iv) effects of changes in air temperature, wind speed, and water depth are inter-dependent, as indicated by enhanced importance of wind and temperature in response to decreasing water depth, as well as reduced importance of depth in response to decreasing wind speed and increasing temperature.";"stratification; mixing; climate change; reservoir management";"CLIMATE-CHANGE; THERMAL STRUCTURE; TEMPERATE LAKES; WATER-QUALITY; PHYTOPLANKTON; IMPACT; WITHDRAWAL; PATTERNS; SOLAR; LIGHT";"Engineering; Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Environmental Sciences; Limnology; Water Resources";"[Kerimoglu, Onur; Rinke, Karsten] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Lake Res, Magdeburg, Germany; [Kerimoglu, Onur] INRA UMR CARRTEL, Thonon Les Bains, France; [Kerimoglu, Onur] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany";Kerimoglu, O (reprint author), Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.;"France; Germany";"France; Germany";"DEU; FRA";1;WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH;;;;;49;11;7518;7527;7518-7527;10.1002/2013WR013520;0043-1397;1944-7973;;0043-1397 eISSN: 1944-7973;;oui;1;2013;non;0;;;;;;5 - Exceptionelle

The rate of soil C accumulation can be determined by measuring soil C stocks over time (diachronic approach) or along a chronosequence that substitutes spatial history differences for time differences (synchronic approach). The objective of this communication is to compare the diachronic and synchronic approaches for determining the rates of soil C storage under NT in the Cerrado region of Brazil. In 2003 and 2007, soil C stocks (0-20 cm) were determined in three NT fields with 5, 9 and 17 years of NT adoption in 2007 (NT-5, NT-9 and NT-17, respectively), one conventionally tilled field (CT, 30 years of tillage in 2007) and one native Cerrado plot (CE) in Rio Verde (Goias state, Brazil). Soil C accumulation rates were calculated following both the synchronic and diachronic approach. Results from the synchronic approach showed that 30 years of cropping under CT depleted the soil C stock to 34.4 Mg C ha(-1), which is a decrease of about 27% of the original levels observed under the native vegetation (CE, 47.1 and 47.3 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, in 2003 and 2007). Instead, NT adoption had been accumulating soil C through the evaluated years. Soil C stocks measured under NT areas in 2003 and 2007 were 29.9 and 31.3 Mg C ha(-1) (NT-5), 33.4 and 34.4 Mg C ha(-1) (NT-9) and 45.8 and 46.4 Mg C ha(-1) (NT-17), respectively. Much more moderate rates of soil C accumulation were observed diachronically (0.12-0.28 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) than with the synchronic approach (133 and 1.27 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in 2003 and 2007, respectively). Soil C stocks under CE between 2003 and 2007 (in the diachronic approach) did not change, indicating that diachronic measurements were accurate. Thus, it appears to be very difficult to eliminate all non-wanted sources of soil C variation (i.e. soil texture, land-use history) analysing the soil C accumulation in a chronosequence (synchronic approach). In spite of a time span of years between sampling dates, our results suggest the need for using the diachronic approach when assessing soil C changes under altering land-use or management patterns. Increasing the number of diachronic assessments may also help the parameterization of process-oriented models for exploring the effects of no-tillage systems on soil C storage rates more accurately.

Scientific disciplines from natural and social science will collaborate both among each other and with relevant societal groups in order to define the important integrated research questions, and to explore together successful pathways towards global sustainability. Such collaboration will be based on transdisciplinarity and integrated research concepts. This paper analyses the relationship between scientific integration and transdisciplinarity, discusses the dimensions of integration of different knowledge and proposes a platform and a paradigm for research towards global sustainability that will be both designed and conducted in partnership between science and society. We argue that integration is an iterative process that involves reflection among all stakeholders.

Permafrost thaw and the degradation of palsa mounds are likely to affect the biogeochemical stability of soil organic matter (that is, SOM resistance to microbial decomposition), which may change the net C source/sink character of palsa peatland ecosystems. In this study, we have assessed both biological and chemical proxies for SOM stability, and we have investigated SOM bulk chemistry with mid-infrared spectroscopy, in surface peat of three distinct peatland features in a palsa peatland in northern Norway. Our results show that the stability of SOM in surface peat as determined by both biological and chemical proxies is consistently higher in the permafrost-associated palsa mounds than in the surrounding internal lawns and bog hummocks. Our results also suggest that differences in SOM bulk chemistry is a main factor explaining the present SOM stability in surface peat of palsa peatlands, with selective preservation of recalcitrant and highly oxidized SOM components in the active layer of palsa mounds during intense aerobic decomposition over time, whereas SOM in the wetter areas of the peatland remains stabilized mainly by anaerobic conditions. The continued degradation of palsa mounds and the expansion of wetter peat areas are likely to modify the bulk SOM chemistry of palsa peatlands, but the effect on the future net C source/sink character of palsa peatlands will largely depend on moisture conditions and oxygen availability in peat.;"palsa peatland; discontinuous permafrost; soil organic matter; potential carbon mineralisation; chemical composition; climate change; infrared spectroscopy";"CLIMATE-CHANGE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; DIFFUSE REFLECTANCE; DRIFT SPECTROSCOPY; FTIR SPECTROSCOPY; NORTHERN SWEDEN; FLUXES; QUALITY; TUNDRA; CYCLE";Environment/Ecology;Ecology;"[Pengerud, Annelene; Johnsen, Line Kristin; Strand, Line Tau] Norwegian Univ Life Sci UMB, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, N-1432 As, Norway; [Cecillon, Lauric] Irstea, UR EMGR Ecosyst Montagnards, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Rasse, Daniel P.] Norwegian Inst Agr & Environm Res, Bioforsk, N-1432 As, Norway";Pengerud, A (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci UMB, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.;"France; Norway";"France; Norway";"FRA; NOR";3;ECOSYSTEMS;;;;;16;6;934;947;;10.1007/s10021-013-9652-5;1432-9840;;;1432-9840;;oui;1;2013;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

Although the underlying mechanisms remain debated, theory holds that both density-dependent and density-independent processes shape the dynamics. One striking example is the large-scale fluctuations of sardine and anchovy observed across the major upwelling areas of the world. Despite a long history of research, the causes of these fluctuations remain unresolved and heavily debated, with significant implications for fisheries management. We here model the underlying causes of these fluctuations, using the California Current Ecosystem as a case study, and show that the dynamics, accurately reproduced since A.D. 1661 onward, are explained by interacting density-dependent processes (i.e., through species-specific life-history traits) and climate forcing. Furthermore, we demonstrate how fishing modifies the dynamics and show that the sardine collapse of the 1950s was largely unavoidable given poor recruitment conditions. Our approach provides unique insight into the origin of sardine-anchovy fluctuations and a knowledge base for sustainable fisheries management in the California Current Ecosystem and beyond.;"species replacement; population modeling; climate change; ecosystem-based management";"PACIFIC SARDINE; NORTHERN ANCHOVY; BALTIC COD; POPULATIONS; RECRUITMENT; COLLAPSE; VARIABILITY; ECOSYSTEMS; REGIME; STOCK";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Lindegren, Martin; Checkley, David M., Jr.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Rouyer, Tristan] IFREMER, UMR 212 EME Ecosyst Marins Exploites, F-34200 Sete, France; [MacCall, Alec D.] NOAA, SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Stenseth, Nils Chr.] Univ Oslo, Dept Biol Sci, CEES, N-0316 Oslo, Norway";Lindegren, M (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92093 USA.;"France; Norway; United States";"France; Norway; United States";"FRA; NOR; USA";13;PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA;;;;;110;33;13672;13677;;10.1073/pnas.1305733110;0027-8424;;;0027-8424;;oui;1;2013;non;0;;;;;;5 - Exceptionelle

Thirty-year climatologies were established for each region and the magnitude of change between 1973 and 2010 was quantified for a variety of climate variables important to crop development. Using a first differences analysis, the aspects of climate that winter wheat yields have been most sensitive to were identified and the impact of changes in these variables on winter wheat yield trends was quantified. A number of aspects of climate have changed at unprecedented rates in the two regions. Between 1973 and 2010, summer precipitation totals decreased by 61% and maximum summer temperatures increased by 4 degrees C in Rostov, while fall precipitation totals decreased by 9% and maximum spring temperatures increased by 2.4 degrees C in Picardy. In addition, winter wheat yields were strongly correlated with a number of climate variables, although the most important drivers of yield variability differed between the two regions. May and June average temperatures explained 49% (p<0.0001) and 16% (p<0.05) of interannual yield variability in Rostov, while in Picardy, November precipitation and minimum summer temperatures explained 26% (p <= 0.001) and 23% (p<0.01). The climate variables that exhibited significant historical trends were often not the climate drivers that winter wheat yields were strongly correlated with in Rostov. Therefore, it appears that recent climate change has not significantly impacted winter wheat yield trends thus far in the region. However, in Picardy, there was partial overlap in the climate variables that winter wheat yields were most responsive to and those that have already exhibited significant changes overtime. Consequently, climate change has likely caused an 11% decrease in winter wheat yield trends in the region. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Among experiments, mesocosms have become increasingly popular because they provide an important bridge between smaller, more tightly controlled, microcosm experiments (which can suffer from limited realism) and the greater biological complexity of natural systems (in which mechanistic relationships often cannot be identified). A new evaluation of the contribution of the mesocosm approach, its potential for future research, as well as its limitations, is timely. As part of this review, we constructed a new database of over 250 post-1990 studies that have explored different components of climate change across a range of organisational levels, scales, and habitats. Issues related to realism, reproducibility and control are assessed in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial systems. Some general patterns emerged, particularly at the ecosystem level, such as consistent and predictable effects on whole-system respiration rates. There are, however, also many seemingly idiosyncratic, contingent responses, especially at the community level, both within and among habitat types. These similarities and differences in both the drivers and responses highlight the need for caution before making generalisations. Finally, we assess future directions and prospects for new methodological advances and the need for greater international coordination and interdisciplinarity.;;"TEMPERATURE-SIZE RULE; FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; CONTINENTAL-SCALE PATTERNS; ECO-EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS; FRESH-WATER MICROCOSMS; SAFE OPERATING SPACE; GLOBAL CARBON-CYCLE; SHALLOW LAKES; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; BODY-SIZE";Environment/Ecology;Ecology;"[Stewart, Rebecca I.

Global change endangers the capacity of mountain ecosystems to provide key services. The Mountland project focused on three case study regions in the Swiss Alps and aimed to propose land-use practices and alternative policy solutions to ensure the provision of key EGS under climate and land-use changes. We summarized and synthesized the results of the project and provide insights into the ecological, socioeconomic, and political processes relevant for analyzing global change impacts on a European mountain region. In Mountland, an integrative approach was applied, combining methods from economics and the political and natural sciences to analyze ecosystem functioning from a holistic human-environment system perspective. In general, surveys, experiments, and model results revealed that climate and socioeconomic changes are likely to increase the vulnerability of the EGS analyzed. We regard the following key characteristics of coupled human-environment systems as central to our case study areas in mountain regions: thresholds, heterogeneity, trade-offs, and feedback. Our results suggest that the institutional framework should be strengthened in a way that better addresses these characteristics, allowing for (1) more integrative approaches, (2) a more network-oriented management and steering of political processes that integrate local stakeholders, and (3) enhanced capacity building to decrease the identified vulnerability as central elements in the policy process. Further, to maintain and support the future provision of EGS in mountain regions, policy making should also focus on project-oriented, cross-sectoral policies and spatial planning as a coordination instrument for land use in general.;"adaptive management; climate change; ecosystem services; experiments; interdisciplinary research; land-use change; modeling; transdisciplinary research";"SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SCOTS PINE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; WOODED PASTURES; SWISS ALPS; HERBACEOUS VEGETATION; NATURAL SYSTEMS; ALPINE TREELINE; COUPLED HUMAN";"Environment/Ecology; Social Sciences";"Ecology; Environmental Studies";"[Huber, Robert; Rigling, Andreas; Lischke, Heike] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Bebi, Peter] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, Davos, Switzerland; [Briner, Simon] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Agrifood & Agrienvironm Econ Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Buttler, Alexandre; Spiegelberger, Thomas] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Lab Ecol Syst ECOS, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Buttler, Alexandre; Gillet, Francois] Univ Franche Comte, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Gillet, Francois] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Gret-Regamey, Adrienne] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Walz, Ariane] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Walz, Ariane] Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Potsdam, Germany; [Brand, Fridolin Simon; Elkin, Che; Hirschi, Christian; Scholz, Roland Werner; Seidl, Roman; Zimmermann, Willi; Bugmann, Harald] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland";Huber, R (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.;"France; Germany; Switzerland";"France; Germany; Switzerland";"CHE; DEU; FRA";8;ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY;;;;;18;3;;;36;10.5751/ES-05499-180336;1708-3087;;;1708-3087;;oui;1;2013;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

Here, we review the current state of knowledge about physiological and ecological responses, with the aim of providing a framework that can help to guide future experimental research. Modelling studies have indicated that elevated ca can potentially stimulate photosynthesis more in the tropics than at higher latitudes, because suppression of photorespiration by elevated ca increases with temperature. However, canopy leaves in tropical forests could also potentially reach a high temperature threshold under elevated ca that will moderate the rise in photosynthesis. Belowground responses, including fine root production, nutrient foraging and soil organic matter processing, will be especially important to the integrated ecosystem response to elevated ca. Water use efficiency will increase as ca rises, potentially impacting upon soil moisture status and nutrient availability. Recruitment may be differentially altered for some functional groups, potentially decreasing ecosystem carbon storage. Whole-forest CO2 enrichment experiments are urgently needed to test predictions of tropical forest functioning under elevated ca.

However, the problem remains of how to quantify these gains. This article considers current greenhouse gas (GHG) quantification methods that can be used in a landscape scale analysis in terms of relevance to areas dominated by smallholders in developing countries. In landscape scale carbon accounting frameworks, measurements are an essential element. Sampling strategies need careful design to account for all pools/fluxes and to ensure judicious use of resources. Models can be used to scale-up measurements and fill data gaps. In recent years a number of accessible models and calculators have been developed which can be used at the landscape scale in developing country areas. Some are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method and others on dynamic ecosystem models. They have been developed for a range of different purposes and therefore vary in terms of accuracy and usability. Landscape scale assessments of GHGs require a combination of ground sampling, use of data from census, remote sensing (RS) or other sources and modelling. Fitting of all of these aspects together needs to be performed carefully to minimize uncertainties and maximize the use of scarce resources.

The former Lake Faguibine in northern Mali has experienced drastic ecological, social, and economic changes. Forests have emerged on the former lake and have become important for local livelihoods. This paper analyses the coping and adapting strategies of forest- and livestock-based livelihoods facing ecological changes. Results from field research at different levels indicate that most local strategies are based on diversification including migration within the livestock production system or in complement to it, with differences according to gender, age, and ethnicity. Political discourses, cultural identities, and past experiences influence and shape adaptation strategies at the local level. The sustainability of the observed strategies depends on the access to natural resources and the sustainable management of these resources, which in turn depends on institutions at local and national levels. Many local strategies are reactive to external events but would need strategic support from higher levels to move from coping to adapting. Examples are the development of institutions and technical actions for natural resource management, as well as development actions supporting local strategies and sustainable investments. Researchers, practitioners and development planners will need simple methods and tools for understanding and analysing local adaptation perceptions and actions to achieve an effective support of sustainable and gender-equitable local adaptation and to avoid mismatches between strategies proposed by local and by sub national and national actors.

Metrics derived from an estimated future climate provide an opportunity to characterise the impacts of climate change on a wide range of agricultural systems, land use practices and ecosystem services. Such indications are vital for determining how changes in the biophysical environment can lead to land management and policy adaptations to achieve multiple objectives of financial viability, food security, biodiversity conservation and environmental sustainability. They provide valuable links between probable management adaptation responses and capacity for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. However, there are large uncertainties associated with projected future climates, including the climate models' spatial scale of representation and those at which agro-meteorological metrics are applied. This paper describes the estimation of agro-meteorological metrics derived from observed weather and downscaled Regional Climate Model projection data for 12 sites in Scotland. Results show that projected changes to seasonal rainfall distribution, growing season length, soil moisture deficits and accessibility will be substantially different from the present climate. Fundamentally, the metrics indicate a substantial shift in land management requirements and potential need for substantial changes in agricultural systems and land use that will have implications across a wide range of research disciplines.

Here, we demonstrate that growth at elevated temperatures (ambient +5 degrees C) affects hydraulic traits in seedlings of the deciduous boreal tree species Populus tremuloides, with the strength of the effect varying with the plant organ studied. Temperature altered the partitioning of hydraulic resistance, with greater resistance attributed to stems and less to roots in warm-grown seedlings (P < 0.02), and a 46% (but marginally significant, P = 0.08) increase in whole plant conductance at elevated temperature. Vulnerability to cavitation was greater in leaves grown at high than at ambient temperatures, but vulnerability in stems was similar between treatments. A soilplantatmosphere (SPA) model suggests that these coordinated changes in hydraulic physiology would lead to more frequent drought stress and reduced water-use efficiency in aspen that develop at warmer temperatures. Tissue-specific trade-offs in hydraulic traits in response to high growth temperatures would be difficult to detect when relying solely on whole plant measurements, but may have large-scale ecological implications for plant water use, carbon cycling and, possibly, plant drought survival.;"cavitation vulnerability; climate change; embolism; poplar; transpiration; water; xylem";"WATER TRANSPORT; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; XYLEM CAVITATION; PONDEROSA PINE; WOODY-PLANTS; LEAF LAMINA; CO2; MODEL; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; VULNERABILITY";Plant & Animal Science;Plant Sciences;"[Way, Danielle A.; Jackson, Robert B.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Way, Danielle A.; Domec, Jean-Christophe; Jackson, Robert B.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Domec, Jean-Christophe] Univ Bordeaux, Bordeaux Sci AGRO, INRA, TCEM,UMR 1220, F-33175 Gradignan, France";Way, DA (reprint author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada.;"Canada; France; United States";"Canada; France; United States";"CAN; FRA; USA";12;PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT;;;;;36;1;103;115;;10.1111/j.1365-3040.2012.02557.x;0140-7791;;;0140-7791;;oui;1;2013;non;0;;;;;;5 - Exceptionelle

However, vulnerability assessments are challenging because of the complexity of multifaceted biophysical, human and institutional factors, interacting at different scales and levels within socio-ecological systems. Using a participatory approach across levels and genders, this paper explores the vulnerability of livestock- and forest-based livelihoods to climate variability and change in Lake Faguibine, northern Mali, where drastic ecological, political and social changes have occurred. Our results show that the distribution of vulnerabilities within livelihoods and groups shifted when the ecosystem evolved from a lake to a forest. New vulnerability drivers have emerged, related to resources availability, access and power relations. In addition, political interests and psychological barriers hinder the local transition to an equitable and sustainable use of forest ecosystem services. Divergent perceptions, social identities, interests and power explained why different actors-governmental and non-governmental, men and women, local, sub-national and national-differed in their vulnerability assessments. This is exemplified in the way actors at different levels and of different gender analysed the effects of herders' mobility and in the way women analysed men's migration. This case study confirms the need for participatory and gender-sensitive vulnerability assessments across different scales and levels that consider the interaction between socio-ecological systems and the dynamics and distribution of vulnerability across different social sub-systems.;"Vulnerability; Climate change; Adaptation; Drylands; Forest-based livelihoods; Ecosystem-based adaptation";"CLIMATE-CHANGE; GLOBAL CHANGE; SAHEL; ADAPTATION; ASSESSMENTS; DIMENSIONS; FRAMEWORK; CONFLICTS; CONTEXT; TUAREG";"Environment/Ecology; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"[Djoudi, Houria; Brockhaus, Maria; Locatelli, Bruno] CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia; [Locatelli, Bruno] CIRAD, Montpellier, France";Djoudi, H (reprint author), CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia.;"France; Indonesia";"France; Indonesia";"FRA; IDN";1;REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE;;;;;13;3;493;508;;10.1007/s10113-011-0262-5;1436-3798;;;1436-3798;;oui;1;2013;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

This results in fluctuations in water availability for food production and other socioeconomic activities. Water harvesting and storage can mitigate the adverse effects of rainfall variability. But past studies have shown that when investments in water storage are not guided by environmental health considerations, the increased availability of open water surface may increase the transmission of water-related diseases. This is demonstrated for schistosomiasis associated with small reservoirs in Burkina Faso, and for malaria in Ethiopia around large dams, small dams, and water harvesting ponds. The concern is that the rush to develop water harvesting and storage for climate change adaptation may increase the risk for already vulnerable people, in some cases more than canceling out the benefits of greater water availability. Taking health issues into account in a participatory approach to planning, design, and management of rainwater harvesting and water storage, as well as considering the full range of water storage options would enable better opportunities for enhancing resilience against climate change in vulnerable populations in sub-Saharan Africa.;"Water storage; Health; Climate change; Africa; Small reservoirs; Water harvesting";"MALARIA TRANSMISSION; NORTHERN ETHIOPIA; BURKINA-FASO; SCHISTOSOMIASIS; IMPACT; DAMS; PARTICIPATION; MANAGEMENT; INFECTION; HIGHLANDS";"Environment/Ecology; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"[Boelee, Eline] IWMI, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Yohannes, Mekonnen] Mekelle Univ, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Poda, Jean-Noel] CNRST, IRSS, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [McCartney, Matthew; Hagos, Fitsum] IWMI, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Cecchi, Philippe] IRD UMR G EAU, IRD, Montpellier, France; [Kibret, Solomon] Univ Addis Ababa, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Laamrani, Hammou] IDRC, Cairo, Egypt";Boelee, E (reprint author), IWMI, Colombo, Sri Lanka.;"Burkina Faso; Egypt; Ethiopia; France; Sri Lanka";"Burkina Faso; Egypt; Ethiopia; France; Sri Lanka";"BFA; EGY; ETH; FRA; LKA";4;REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE;;;;;13;3;509;519;;10.1007/s10113-012-0287-4;1436-3798;;;1436-3798;;oui;1;2013;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

Are the technologies promoted those most needed by the recipient countries? We address this question by first reviewing Technology Needs Assessments prepared by developing countries, and then comparing the stated needs to the technologies most frequently promoted via CDM. While there appears to be a good match between requested technologies and those used in CDM, desired technologies such as solar energy for remote locations, biofuels, improved cooking stoves, and efficient lighting appear neglected by CDM. Nonetheless, a review of costs for these technologies suggests that many could be cost effective for developing countries. For projects requiring wide dispersal of household items, such as cooking stoves or lighting, the administrative burdens of CDM provide a hurdle. In other cases, difficulties quantifying the ancillary benefits of these projects hinder the promotion of these technologies. We conclude with possible explanations for why these technologies are neglected and suggestions for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, climate change and global warming in Mediterranean areas can imply consequences on both flash flood and fire hazards, by amplifying these phenomena. Based on historical events and post-fire experience, a methodology to interpret the impacts of forest fire in terms of rainfall-runoff model parameters has been proposed. It allows to estimate the consequences of forest fire at the watershed scale depending on the considered burned area. In a second stage, the combined effect of forest fire and climate change has been analysed to map the future risk of forest fire and their consequence on flood occurrence. This study has been conducted on the Llobregat river basin (Spain), a catchment of approximately 5,000 km(2) frequently affected by flash floods and forest fires. The results show that forest fire can modify the hydrological response at the watershed scale when the burned area is significant.

We therefore analysed blooming dates over long periods at climate-contrasted sites in Western Europe, focusing mainly on the Golden Delicious apple that is grown worldwide. On average, blooming advances were more pronounced in northern continental (10 days) than in western oceanic (6-7 days) regions, while the shortest advance was found on the Mediterranean coastline. Temporal trends toward blooming phase shortenings were also observed in continental regions. These regional differences in temporal variability across Western Europe resulted in a decrease in spatial variability, i.e. shorter time intervals between blooming dates in contrasted regions (8-10-day decrease for full bloom between Mediterranean and continental regions). Fitted sequential models were used to reproduce phenological changes. Marked trends toward shorter simulated durations of forcing period (bud growth from dormancy release to blooming) and high positive correlations between these durations and observed blooming dates support the notion that blooming advances and shortenings are mainly due to faster satisfaction of the heating requirement. However, trends toward later dormancy releases were also noted in oceanic and Mediterranean regions. This could tend toward blooming delays and explain the shorter advances in these regions despite similar or greater warming. The regional differences in simulated chilling and forcing periods were consistent with the regional differences in temperature increases.;"Chilling; Heating; Modelling; Fruit tree; Global warming";"FLOWERING TIME; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRUIT-TREES; TEMPERATURE; MODELS; TRENDS; FROST; CULTIVARS; BUDBURST; IMPACT";"Biology & Biochemistry; Clinical Medicine; Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Biophysics; Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Physiology";"[Legave, Jean Michel] INRA, UMR AGAP, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Blanke, Michael] Univ Bonn, INRES Hort Sci, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Christen, Danilo] Agroscope Changins Wadenswill, CH-1964 Conthey, Switzerland; [Giovannini, Daniela] CRA, Unita Ric Frutticoltura, I-47121 Forli, Italy; [Mathieu, Vincent] Ctifl, Ctr Balandran, F-30127 Bellegarde, France; [Oger, Robert] CRA W, Agr & Milieu Nat, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium";Legave, JM (reprint author), INRA, UMR AGAP, Ave Agropolis, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.;"Belgium; France; Germany; Italy; Switzerland";"Belgium; France; Germany; Italy; Switzerland";"BEL; CHE; DEU; FRA; ITA";10;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY;;;;;57;2;317;331;;10.1007/s00484-012-0551-9;0020-7128;;;0020-7128;;oui;1;2013;non;0;;;;;;3 - Correcte

This is because basic model assumptions are violated and variables available to forest managers are rarely used. In this paper, we present a method which addresses the aforementioned shortcomings. The approach is illustrated through a case study of Pinus pinea L Our findings will also shed light on the role of germination in the general failure of natural regeneration in managed forests of this species. The presented technique consists of a mixed regression model based on survival analysis. Climate and stand covariates were tested. Data for fitting the model were gathered from a 5-year germination experiment in a mature, managed P. pinea stand in the Northern Plateau of Spain in which two different stand densities can be found. The model predictions proved to be unbiased and highly accurate when compared with the training data. Germination in P. pinea was controlled through thermal variables at stand level. At microsite level, low densities negatively affected the probability of germination. A time-lag in the response was also detected. Overall, the proposed technique provides a reliable alternative to germination modelling in ecology/forestry studies by using accessible/suitable variables. The P. pinea case study highlights the importance of producing unbiased predictions. In this species, the occurrence and timing of germination suggest a very different regeneration strategy from that understood by forest managers until now, which may explain the high failure rate of natural regeneration in managed stands. In addition, these findings provide valuable information for the management of P. pinea under climate-change conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

As a consequence prices for carbon emission allowances in the EU Emissions Trading System collapsed. However, this price collapse may be amplified by the interaction of a carbon emission cap with supplementary policy targets such as minimum shares for renewables in the power sector. The static interaction between climate and renewable policies has been discussed extensively. This paper extends this debate by analysing the efficiency and effectiveness of a policy portfolio containing a cap and trade scheme and a target for a minimum renewable share in different states of aggregate electricity demand. Making use of a simple partial equilibrium model of the power sector we identify an asymmetric interaction of emissions trading and renewable quotas with respect to different states of aggregate electricity demand. The results imply that unintended consequences of the policy interaction may be particularly severe and costly when aggregate electricity demand is low and that carbon prices are more sensitive to changes in economic activity if they are applied in combination with renewable energy targets. Our analysis of the policy interaction focuses on the EU, yet the conclusions may also be of relevance for fast growing emerging economies like China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We apply both approaches based on the outputs of a global climate model (GCM), ARPEGE-CLIMAT, under three possible future scenarios (B1, A1B and A2) of the Fourth Assessment Report, AR4 (IPCC, 2007), along the French coast and evaluate their results for the wave climate with a high level of precision. The performance of the dynamical and the statistical methods is determined through a comparative analysis of the estimated means, standard deviations and monthly quantile distributions of significant wave heights, the joint probability distributions of wave parameters and seasonal and interannual variability. Analysis of the results shows that the statistical projections are able to reproduce the wave climatology as well as the dynamical projections, with some deficiencies being observed in the summer and for the upper tail of the significant wave height. In addition, with its low computational time requirements, the statistical downscaling method allows an ensemble of simulations to be calculated faster than the dynamical method. It then becomes possible to quantify the uncertainties associated with the choice of the GCM or the socio-economic scenarios, which will improve estimates of the impact of wave climate change along the French coast.

Whether forests continue to act as a global sink will depend on many factors, including the response of aboveground wood production (AWP; MgCha(-1)yr(-1)) to climate change. Here, we explore how AWP in New Zealand's natural forests is likely to change. We start by statistically modelling the present-day growth of 97199 individual trees within 1070 permanently marked inventory plots as a function of tree size, competitive neighbourhood and climate. We then use these growth models to identify the factors that most influence present-day AWP and to predict responses to medium-term climate change under different assumptions. We find that if the composition and structure of New Zealand's forests were to remain unchanged over the next 30years, then AWP would increase by 6-23%, primarily as a result of physiological responses to warmer temperatures (with no appreciable effect of changing rainfall). However, if warmth-requiring trees were able to migrate into currently cooler areas and if denser canopies were able to form, then a different AWP response is likely: forests growing in the cool mountain environments would show a 30% increase in AWP, while those in the lowland would hardly respond (on average, -3% when mean annual temperature exceeds 8.0 degrees C). We conclude that response of wood production to anthropogenic climate change is not only dependent on the physiological responses of individual trees, but is highly contingent on whether forests adjust in composition and structure.";"forest inventories; forest wood production; hierarchical Bayes; temperate rainforest; terrestrial carbon sink; tree growth";"NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; NEW-ZEALAND; TREE GROWTH; TROPICAL FORESTS; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; PLANT RESPIRATION; NATURAL FOREST; TEMPERATURE; MODEL; LEAF";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Coomes, David A.; Jucker, Tommaso; Lines, Emily R.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Forest Ecol & Conservat Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Flores, Olivier] Univ Reunion, UMR Peuplements Vegetaux & Bioagresseursen Milieu, F-97715 St Denis Messageries, France; [Holdaway, Robert] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Lines, Emily R.] UCL, Dept Geog, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Vanderwel, Mark C.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA";Coomes, DA (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Forest Ecol & Conservat Grp, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England.;"France; New Zealand; United Kingdom; United States";"France; New Zealand; United Kingdom; United States";"FRA; GBR; NZL; USA";5;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;20;12;3632;3645;;10.1111/gcb.12622;1354-1013;1365-2486;;1354-1013 eISSN: 1365-2486;;oui;1;2014;non;0;;;;;;5 - Exceptionelle

Among terrestrial ecosystems, forests will be profoundly impacted by drier climatic conditions, with drastic consequences for the functions and services they supply. Simultaneously, biodiversity is known to support a wide range of forest ecosystem functions and services. However, whether biodiversity also improves the resistance of these ecosystems to drought remains unclear. We compared soil drought exposure levels in a total of 160 forest stands within five major forest types across Europe along a gradient of tree species diversity. We assessed soil drought exposure in each forest stand by calculating the stand-level increase in carbon isotope composition of late wood from a wet to a dry year (Delta delta C-13(S)). delta C-13(S) exhibited a negative linear relationship with tree species diversity in two forest types, suggesting that species interactions in these forests diminished the drought exposure of the ecosystem. However, the other three forest types were unaffected by tree species diversity. We conclude that higher diversity enhances resistance to drought events only in drought-prone environments. Managing forest ecosystems for high tree species diversity does not necessarily assure improved adaptability to the more severe and frequent drought events predicted for the future.;"climate change; ecology; species interaction; carbon isotope composition; FundivEUROPE";"BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; CARBON; ECOLOGY; STANDS; BEECH";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Grossiord, Charlotte; Granier, Andre; Bonal, Damien] INRA, Unite Mixte Rech 1137, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Ratcliffe, Sophia] Univ Leipzig, Inst Spezielle Bot & Funkt Biodiversitat, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Bouriaud, Olivier] Univ Suceava, Fac Forestry, Suceava 720229, Romania; [Bruelheide, Helge] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, D-06108 Halle, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Checko, Ewa] Univ Warsaw, Bialowieza Geobot Stn, Fac Biol, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland; [Forrester, David Ian] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; [Dawud, Seid Muhie] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Finer, Leena] Finnish Forest Res Inst, Joensuu 80101, Finland; [Pollastrini, Martina] Univ Florence, Sect Soil & Plant Sci, Dept Agri Food & Environm Sci, I-50144 Florence, Italy; [Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol Geobot, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Valladares, Fernando] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Gessler, Arthur] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Gessler, Arthur] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res, D-14195 Berlin, Germany";Bonal, D (reprint author), INRA, Unite Mixte Rech 1137, F-54280 Champenoux, France.;"Denmark; Finland; France; Germany; Italy; Poland; Romania; Spain; Switzerland";"Denmark; Finland; France; Germany; Italy; Poland; Romania; Spain; Switzerland";"CHE; DEU; DNK; ESP; FIN; FRA; ITA; POL; ROU";3;PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA;;;;;111;41;14812;14815;;10.1073/pnas.1411970111;0027-8424;;;0027-8424;;oui;1;2014;non;0;;;;;;5 - Exceptionelle

While optimal management options and yields attainable on a commercial scale are still debated, no study has yet addressed its removal and potential effects on following crops. Here, we present results from a trial involving a 20-year old Miscanthus stand on i) soil C, N, P and K stocks, compared with an adjacent field cultivated with a rotation of annual arable food crops, ii) the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions following the removal of Miscanthus and iii) the immediate short-term effects on the following land use (re-cultivation to wheat or set-aside). Compared to the adjacent field under annual crops, the Miscanthus plot had a larger soil organic C stock (by 13 t C ha(-1)) but a similar N stock, and lower P and K stocks (with differences of 100 kg P ha(-1) and 1170 kg K ha(-1), respectively). These losses imply that some degree of fertilization may be necessary as compensation. The effects of Miscanthus removal for the following wheat were significant on crop N content but negligible on grain yield. 1.5 t CO2 ha(-1) of CO2 were released after the Miscanthus removal and the N2O emissions increased from 150 g N2O-N ha(-1) to 493 g N2O-N ha(-1) during the following year. These results highlight the importance of investigation of the end-of-life stage of perennial crops for an accurate assessment of their environmental impacts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Terrestrial ecosystems account for nearly 70% of total global N2O atmospheric loading, of which at least 45% can be attributed to microbial cycling of nitrogen in agriculture(3). The reduction of N2O to nitrogen gas by microorganisms is critical for mitigating its emissions from terrestrial ecosystems, yet the determinants of a soil's capacity to act as a source or sink for N2O remain uncertain(4). Here, we demonstrate that the soil N2O sink capacity is mostly explained by the abundance and phylogenetic diversity of a newly described N2O-reducing microbial group(5,6), which mediate the influence of edaphic factors. Analyses of interactions and niche preference similarities suggest niche differentiation or even competitive interactions between organisms with the two types of N2O reductase. We further identified several recurring communities comprised of co-occurring N2O-reducing bacterial genotypes that were significant indicators of the soil N2O sink capacity across different European soils.;;"NITROUS-OXIDE REDUCTASE; DENITRIFIER COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; GENES; ABUNDANCE";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Jones, Christopher M.; Spor, Ayme; Brennan, Fiona P.; Breuil, Marie-Christine; Bru, David; Lemanceau, Philippe; Philippot, Laurent] INRA, UMR Agroecol 1347, F-21065 Dijon, France; [Jones, Christopher M.; Hallin, Sara] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Microbiol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Brennan, Fiona P.; Griffiths, Bryan] TEAGASC, Environm Res Ctr, Wexford, Ireland; [Brennan, Fiona P.] James Hutton Inst, Ecol Sci Grp, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Griffiths, Bryan] SRUC, Crop & Soil Syst Res Grp, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland";Hallin, S (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Microbiol, Box 7025, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.;"France; Ireland; Sweden; United Kingdom";"France; Ireland; Sweden; United Kingdom";"FRA; GBR; IRL; SWE";9;NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE;;;;;4;9;801;805;;10.1038/NCLIMATE2301;1758-678X;1758-6798;;1758-678X eISSN: 1758-6798;;oui;1;2014;non;0;;;;;;5 - Exceptionelle

Using Indonesia and Vietnam as case studies, we identify challenges at the national level but opportunities at the local level. Although both countries demonstrate political commitment to integrating adaptation and mitigation in their development plans, guidelines for policy and planning treat the two approaches separately. The main challenges identified are lack of knowledge, lack of political will, lack of financial incentives, and fragmentation of mandates and tasks of different government agencies. In contrast, at the local level, integration of mitigation and adaptation is facilitated by subnational autonomy, where mitigation projects might have adaptation co-benefits, and vice versa. Our results also show that many actors have a dual mandate that could bridge adaptation and mitigation if appropriate political and financial incentives are put in place. Successful integration of mitigation and adaptation policies would not only remove contradictions between policies, but also encourage governments that are designing domestic policies to exploit the potential for positive spillovers and realize the benefits of both approaches.;"adaptation; mitigation; synthesis; Indonesia; Vietnam";"ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY; EUROPEAN-UNION; GOVERNANCE; POLITICS; STATE";Plant & Animal Science;Forestry;"[Pham Thu Thuy] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Moeliono, Moira; Brockhaus, Maria; Mardiah, Sofi] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor 16115, Barat, Indonesia; [Locatelli, Bruno] Agr Res Dev CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Locatelli, Bruno] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Lima 15024, Peru; [Di Gregorio, Monica] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England";Thuy, PT (reprint author), Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, 17A Nguyen Khang St, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam.;"France; Indonesia; Peru; United Kingdom; Vietnam";"France; Indonesia; Peru; United Kingdom; Vietnam";"FRA; GBR; IDN; PER; VNM";0;FORESTS;;;;;5;8;2016;2036;;10.3390/f5082016;1999-4907;;;1999-4907;;oui;1;2014;non;0;;;;;;3 - Correcte

We analyzed growth and sap flow responses for a 3-year period including the most stressful drought over the last half century in the evergreen Pinus nigra and the deciduous Quercus faginea, two dominant tree species in the continental plateau of the Iberian Peninsula. Our aim was to quantify the differential impacts of this event on the performance of both species and their modulation by local microclimate. Growth was registered with digital dendrometers, and water use was assessed by continuously recording sap flow in 8-9 coexisting adult individuals of each species in two sites. Q. faginea spring growth rate decreased by 60 % during the dry year at the dry site, while the decrease in P. nigra was around 36 %. P. nigra exhibited larger sap flow reductions during the dry season and also larger decreases during the extreme year, but in contrast to Q. faginea, it was able to recover growth and sap flow values after the extreme drought. Minor microclimatic differences between sites had significant effects on growth and water use, with slightly more mesic conditions significantly attenuating the impact of drought on both species. Findings suggest that the study species were near to their tolerance thresholds, so that even moderate increases in the intensity and frequency of unusual droughts have important consequences for individual tree performance, and eventually species coexistence and ecosystem processes.;"Extreme drought; Pinus nigra; Quercus faginea; Climate change; Mediterranean forests";"WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; OAK QUERCUS-PUBESCENS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SCOTS PINE; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTANCE; CANOPY CONDUCTANCE; USE STRATEGIES; DIE-OFF; VEGETATION MORTALITY; STAND TRANSPIRATION";"Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry";"[Forner, Alicia; Valladares, Fernando] MNCN, CSIC, Dept Biogeog & Cambio Global, Lab Int Cambio Global LINC Global, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Aranda, Ismael] INIA, Forest Res Ctr, Dept Forest Ecol & Genet, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Granier, Andre] INRA, UMR Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres 1137, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Valladares, Fernando] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, Dept Biol & Geol, Mostoles 28933, Spain";Forner, A (reprint author), MNCN, CSIC, Dept Biogeog & Cambio Global, Lab Int Cambio Global LINC Global, Serrano 115 Dpdo, Madrid 28006, Spain.;"France; Spain";"France; Spain";"ESP; FRA";1;PLANT ECOLOGY;;;;;215;7;703;719;;10.1007/s11258-014-0351-x;1385-0237;1573-5052;;1385-0237 eISSN: 1573-5052;;oui;1;2014;non;0;;;;;;3 - Correcte

Yet, it is unclear how different taxonomic groups may respond to climate warming over larger altitudinal ranges. Here, we used data from the national biodiversity monitoring program of Switzerland, collected over an altitudinal range of 2500 m. Within the short period of eight years (2003-2010), we found significant shifts in communities of vascular plants, butterflies and birds. At low altitudes, communities of all species groups changed towards warm-dwelling species, corresponding to an average uphill shift of 8 m, 38 m and 42 m in plant, butterfly and bird communities, respectively. However, rates of community changes decreased with altitude in plants and butterflies, while bird communities changed towards warm-dwelling species at all altitudes. We found no decrease in community variation with respect to temperature niches of species, suggesting that climate warming has not led to more homogenous communities. The different community changes depending on altitude could not be explained by different changes of air temperatures, since during the 16 years between 1995 and 2010, summer temperatures in Switzerland rose by about 0.07 degrees C per year at all altitudes. We discuss that land-use changes or increased disturbances may have prevented alpine plant and butterfly communities from changing towards warm-dwelling species. However, the findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that unlike birds, many alpine plant species in a warming climate could find suitable habitats within just a few metres, due to the highly varied surface of alpine landscapes. Our results may thus support the idea that for plants and butterflies and on a short temporal scale, alpine landscapes are safer places than lowlands in a warming world.;;"SWISS ALPS; ALPINE PLANTS; RANGE SHIFTS; PINUS-CEMBRA; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; VEGETATION; HOMOGENIZATION; TEMPERATURES; INDICATORS";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Roth, Tobias; Plattner, Matthias] Hintermann & Weber AG, Reinach, Switzerland; [Roth, Tobias; Amrhein, Valentin] Univ Basel, Inst Zool, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland; [Roth, Tobias; Amrhein, Valentin] Res Stn Petite Camargue Alsacienne, St Louis, France";Roth, T (reprint author), Hintermann & Weber AG, Reinach, Switzerland.;"France; Switzerland";"France; Switzerland";"CHE; FRA";3;PLOS ONE;;;;;9;1;;;e82490;10.1371/journal.pone.0082490;1932-6203;;;1932-6203;;oui;1;2014;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

Nevertheless most of these patents are solvent oriented. With CO2 capture technology development, a sharp increase of process improvement patents and scientific articles can be witnessed since 2004 in parallel with the development of new solvents. In this work, a thorough review of patent database and open literature has been carried out in order to be as exhaustive as possible. The individual process modifications and patents are analyzed and then generalised into elementary modification groups. These elementary modifications are then sorted into main categories related to their effect on the process. In total, 20 elementary modifications have been sorted into three main categories: absorption enhancement (increasing rich loading or reducing absorption driving force difference along column height), thermal integration (minimizing the rejected heat of process and excessive thermal driving force) and heat pump effect (increasing heat quality with electricity). Figure 1 summarizes these modifications and shows an illustrative flow scheme for each of them. In the final paper, their mean of action will be described and discussed in relation to their induced complexity, flexibility, cost and expected performances. (C) 2014 The Authors.

This information is pivotal to quantifying all the hazard consequences associated with the failure of CO2 transportation pipelines, which forms the basis for emergency response planning and determining minimum safe distances to populated areas. This paper presents an overview of the main findings of the recently completed CO(2)PipeHaz project [1] which focussed on the hazard assessment of CO2 pipelines to be employed as an integral part of CCS.

In Europe, the Storage Directive (EC, 2009) provides a legislative framework, implemented by Member States, which requires appropriate project design to ensure the storage of CO2 is permanent and safe. However, it is incumbent on storage site operators to demonstrate an understanding of the potential impacts on surface ecosystems should a leak occur. The RISCS (Research into Impacts and Safety in CO2 Storage) project has produced a Guide to potential impacts of leakage from CO2 storage (the 'Guide'). RISCS assessed the potential effects of CO2 leakage from geological storage on both onshore and offshore near-surface ecosystems and on potable ground water. This assessment was achieved through laboratory and field experiments, through observations at sites of natural CO2 seepage and through numerical simulations. The Guide summarises some of the key findings of the project. The Guide provides information on the best approaches to evaluate potential impacts of hypothetical leakage from CO2 storage sites and to provide guidance on appraising these impacts. This information will be relevant to regulators and operators in particular, but also to other stakeholders who are concerned with CO2 storage, such as national and local governments, and members of the public.

It targets specifically low-medium tonnage CO2 emitters (ca. 10-150 kt/yr) because the amount of dissolved CO2 that can be injected into a geothermal saline aquifer is physically limited by the solubility of CO2 in brine. This work makes an inventory of the potential candidates to the CO2-DISSOLVED concept in France, Germany, and the U.S.A. The results evidenced that relatively large geothermal areas match the presence of many industrial sources emitting low rates of CO2, allowing us to conclude on the potential applicability of the concept in these three countries.

These projects include the ROAD project (The Netherlands) and the Don Valley project (UK). The Hontomin project (Spain) can be regarded as the third project, as it was developed as the research site for the Compostilla project in Spain; the Compostilla project, also a beneficiary of EEPR funds, was discontinued in 2013 after completing FEED studies. The Sleipner project joined the Network in 2011 and provided its experience and expertise to the EEPR funded projects. Together, the projects in the Network cover a wide range of storage options, from a depleted gas field to saline sandstone and carbonate formations. The ROAD project uses a compartment of an offshore depleted gas field, and the Don Valley project is developing an offshore saline aquifer. The Hontomin site, dedicated to research, uses an onshore carbonate reservoir. This paper gives an overview of the storage solutions developed or under development by these projects.

The large-scale datasets include the streamflow records held in the European Water Archive and the WATCH large-scale model ensemble. National studies are available from Norway, the UK, southern Germany, Austria and France. The comparison shows that large-scale model experiments focus mostly on the general pattern of seasonal flow changes, whereas national to regional scale studies tend to focus on absolute low flow values and deficits below relevant thresholds and often stratify their assessments by hydrological regime or dominant process control. The study concludes that different levels of information can indeed benefit synthesis assessments of low flow changes at the hydrological planning scale.;"low flow; Europe; climate change; trend analysis; scenarios";"TRENDS; CATCHMENTS; IMPACTS; RUNOFF; FRANCE; UK";"Engineering; Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Water Resources";"[Stahl, Kerstin] Univ Freiburg, Chair Hydrol, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany; [Vidal, Jean-Philippe] Irstea, UR HHLY, F-69626 Villeurbanne, France; [Hannaford, Jamie; Prudhomme, Christel] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Laaha, Gregor] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, BOKU Vienna, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Tallaksen, Lena M.] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway";Stahl, K (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Chair Hydrol, Fahnenbergpl, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany.;"Austria; France; Germany; Norway; United Kingdom";"Austria; France; Germany; Norway; United Kingdom";"AUT; DEU; FRA; GBR; NOR";0;HYDROLOGY IN A CHANGING WORLD: ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN DIMENSIONS;IAHS Publication;7th World FRIEND-Water Conference on Hydrology in a Changing World: Environmental and Human Dimensions;OCT 07-10, 2014;Montpellier, FRANCE;363;;30;35;;;0144-7815;;978-1-907161-41-4;0144-7815;7th World FRIEND-Water Conference on Hydrology in a Changing World: Environmental and Human Dimensions Date: OCT 07-10, 2014 Location: Montpellier, FRANCE;oui;1;2014;non;0;;;;;;0 - Sans notoriété

First statistical tests showed that both flood frequency and severity increased between the two distinct periods in the 1970s and 1990s. During the same period an increase in accumulated rainfall amount over several days and an increasing urbanisation from 20 to 35% of the catchment area was observed. In order to assess the influence of each change a diachronic approach was used with rainfall and land-use data from the two periods of the 1970s and 1990s. The data were used to calibrate a distributed hydrologic model. The simulations showed the respective effect of both, climate change (through rainfall regime change) and urban development on flood frequency and flood risk.;"climate change; simulation model; flood regime";;"Engineering; Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Water Resources";"[Radojevic, Biljana; Dimkic, Dejan] UNESCO Cat II Ctr, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Breil, Pascal] IRSTEA Inst, Lyon Ctr, Hydrol Hydraul Res Unit, F-69626 Villeurbanne, France";Radojevic, B (reprint author), UNESCO Cat II Ctr, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.;"France; Serbia";"France; Serbia";"FRA; SRB";0;HYDROLOGY IN A CHANGING WORLD: ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN DIMENSIONS;IAHS Publication;7th World FRIEND-Water Conference on Hydrology in a Changing World: Environmental and Human Dimensions;OCT 07-10, 2014;Montpellier, FRANCE;363;;48;53;;;0144-7815;;978-1-907161-41-4;0144-7815;7th World FRIEND-Water Conference on Hydrology in a Changing World: Environmental and Human Dimensions Date: OCT 07-10, 2014 Location: Montpellier, FRANCE;oui;1;2014;non;0;;;;;;0 - Sans notoriété

This article reviews demand modeling approaches from 10 global economic models participating in the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP). We compare food demand projections in 2050 for various regions and agricultural products under harmonized scenarios of socioeconomic development, climate change, and bioenergy expansion. In the reference scenario (SSP2), food demand increases by 59-98% between 2005 and 2050, slightly higher than the most recent FAO projection of 54% from 2005/2007. The range of results is large, in particular for animal calories (between 61% and 144%), caused by differences in demand systems specifications, and in income and price elasticities. The results are more sensitive to socioeconomic assumptions than to climate change or bioenergy scenarios. When considering a world with higher population and lower economic growth (SSP3), consumption per capita drops on average by 9% for crops and 18% for livestock. The maximum effect of climate change on calorie availability is -6% at the global level, and the effect of biofuel production on calorie availability is even smaller.;"World food demand; Socioeconomic pathways; Climate change; Computable general equilibrium; Partial equilibrium";SYSTEMS;Economics & Business;"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics";"[Valin, Hugo; Havlik, Petr] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Sands, Ronald D.] Econ Res Serv, Resource & Rural Econ Div, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [van der Mensbrugghe, Dominique] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Agr Dev Econ Div ESAD, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Nelson, Gerald C.; Mason-D'Croz, Daniel] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Nelson, Gerald C.] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61801 USA; [Ahammad, Helal; Heyhoe, Edwina] ABARES, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Blanc, Elodie; Paltsev, Sergey] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Bodirsky, Benjamin; Rolinski, Susanne] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Fujimori, Shinichiro; Hasegawa, Tomoko] Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, NIES, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Kyle, Page] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Tabeau, Andrzej; van Meijl, Hans] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Agr Econ Res Inst LEI, NL-2585 DB The Hague, Netherlands; [von Lampe, Martin] OECD, TAD, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Willenbockel, Dirk] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England";Valin, H (reprint author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.;"Australia; Austria; France; Germany; Italy; Japan; Netherlands; United Kingdom; United States";"Australia; Austria; France; Germany; Italy; Japan; Netherlands; United Kingdom; United States";"AUS; AUT; DEU; FRA; GBR; ITA; JPN; NLD; USA";15;AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS;;;;;45;1;51;67;;10.1111/agec.12089;0169-5150;1574-0862;;0169-5150 eISSN: 1574-0862;;oui;1;2014;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

Retrospective simulation modeling allowed us to recreate organic carbon dynamics during the exploitation period of a cropping system from 1991 to 2009. Beginning with an initial carbon stock equal to that measured in the undisturbed forest (14.8t C ha(-1)), predicted carbon stocks after 18 years of different crop rotations were of the same order as the mean stock measured in the cropped zone in 2009 (8.1 t C ha(-1)). The sustainability of the cropping systems that may be established in the future was evaluated with prospective simulation from 2009 to 2080, taking climate change scenarios into account. Rotations of continuous crops, even with fallow periods, led to loss carbon stock of about 5 and 6 t C ha(-1), which may involve decrease in land productivity in the long term. Agroforestry systems generated relatively large gains in soil organic carbon, which could render local cropping systems sustainable. The effect of climate change on changes in soil organic carbon appeared of secondary importance compared to inputs of carbon from spontaneous or sown vegetation associated with crop rotations.

ARTEM-WQ is based on a sequential risk analysis approach that includes consideration of catchment characteristics, climatic conditions and treatment operations. It provides a holistic evaluation of the water system, while also assessing human health risks of organic contaminants potentially present in treated waters (steroids, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, bisphenol-a, polychlorobiphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, petrochemical hydrocarbons and disinfection by-products; n = 109). Moreover, the system provides recommendations for improvement while supporting decision making in its widest context. The tool has been tested on various European catchments and shows a promising potential to inform water managers of risks and appropriate mitigative actions. Further improvements should include toxicological knowledge advancement, environmental background pollutant concentrations and the assessment of the impact of distribution systems on water quality variation.";"decision support system; drinking water; small and medium scale water services; health risks assessment; climate change; organic carbon";"DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESSES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WASTE-WATER; RIVER-BASIN; RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; SURFACE WATERS; PHARMACEUTICALS; CONTAMINANTS; QUALITY";Environment/Ecology;Environmental Sciences;"[Delpla, Ianis; Baures, Estelle; Jung, Aude-Valerie; Thomas, Olivier] Sorbonne Paris Cite, Adv Sch Publ Hlth, F-74312 Rennes CS, France; [Delpla, Ianis; Baures, Estelle; Jung, Aude-Valerie; Thomas, Olivier] Univ Rennes 1, LERES, INSERM, Inst Res Environm & Occupat Hlth IRSET U1085, F-74312 Rennes CS, France; [Delpla, Ianis; Baures, Estelle; Jung, Aude-Valerie; Thomas, Olivier] European Univ Brittany, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Delpla, Ianis] Univ Laval, Ecole Super Amenagement Terr & Dev Reg, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Monteith, Donald T.] Univ Lancaster, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Lancaster LA1 4AP, England; [Freeman, Chris; Jones, Timothy G.] Bangor Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Wolfson Carbon Capture Lab, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Haftka, Joris; Hermens, Joop] Univ Utrecht, Inst Risk Assessment Sci, Div Toxicol, NL-3508 TD Utrecht, Netherlands; [Jung, Aude-Valerie] Sch Environm Engn, F-35170 Bruz, France";Thomas, O (reprint author), Sorbonne Paris Cite, Adv Sch Publ Hlth, Ave Prof Leon Bernard, F-74312 Rennes CS, France.;"Canada; France; Netherlands; United Kingdom";"Canada; France; Netherlands; United Kingdom";"CAN; FRA; GBR; NLD";0;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH;;;;;11;7;7354;7375;;10.3390/ijerph110707354;1660-4601;;;1660-4601;;oui;1;2014;non;0;;;;;;3 - Correcte

While a broad variety of maize simulation models exist, it is not known whether different models diverge on grain yield responses to changes in climatic factors, or whether they agree in their general trends related to phenology, growth, and yield. With the goal of analyzing the sensitivity of simulated yields to changes in temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations [CO2], we present the largest maize crop model intercomparison to date, including 23 different models. These models were evaluated for four locations representing a wide range of maize production conditions in the world: Lusignan (France), Ames (USA), Rio Verde (Brazil) and Morogoro (Tanzania). While individual models differed considerably in absolute yield simulation at the four sites, an ensemble of a minimum number of models was able to simulate absolute yields accurately at the four sites even with low data for calibration, thus suggesting that using an ensemble of models has merit. Temperature increase had strong negative influence on modeled yield response of roughly -0.5 Mg ha(-1) per degrees C. Doubling [CO2] from 360 to 720 mu mol mol(-1) increased grain yield by 7.5% on average across models and the sites. That would therefore make temperature the main factor altering maize yields at the end of this century. Furthermore, there was a large uncertainty in the yield response to [CO2] among models. Model responses to temperature and [CO2] did not differ whether models were simulated with low calibration information or, simulated with high level of calibration information.;"[CO2]; AgMIP; climate; maize; model intercomparison; simulation; temperature; uncertainty";"WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; AIR CO2 ENRICHMENT; SIMULATION-MODEL; ELEVATED CO2; SYSTEMS SIMULATION; NITROGEN DYNAMICS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; YIELD; WHEAT; AGRICULTURE";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Bassu, Simona; Brisson, Nadine; Makowski, David] INRA AgroParisTech, Unite Agron, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Durand, Jean-Louis] INRA, Unite Rech Pluridisciplinaire Prairie & Plantes F, F-86600 Lusignan, France; [Boote, Kenneth] Univ Florida, Dept Agron, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Lizaso, Jon; Sau, Federico] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Prod Vegetal, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Jones, James W.] Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Rosenzweig, Cynthia; Ruane, Alex C.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, Climate Impacts Grp, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Adam, Myriam] CIRAD, UMR AGAP PAM, Montpellier, France; [Baron, Christian] CIRAD, UMR TETIS, F-34093 Montpellier, France; [Basso, Bruno; Shcherbak, Iurii] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Basso, Bruno; Shcherbak, Iurii] Univ Basilicata, Dept Crop Syst Forestry & Environm Sci, I-85100 Potenza, Italy; [Biernath, Christian; Priesack, Eckart] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Bodenokol, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Boogaard, Hendrik; Hoek, Steven] Alterra, Ctr Geoinformat, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Conijn, Sjaak; Jongschaap, Raymond] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, WUR Plant Res Int, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Corbeels, Marc] CIRAD Annual Cropping Syst, BR-73310970 Planaltina, DF, Brazil; [Deryng, Delphine] Univ E Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Deryng, Delphine] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [De Sanctis, Giacomo] INRA, Unite AGROCLIM, F-84914 Avignon 9, France; [Gayler, Sebastian] Univ Tubingen, Water & Earth Syst Sci WESS Competence Cluster, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Grassini, Patricio] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agron & Hort, Lincoln, NE 68503 USA; [Hatfield, Jerry] USDA ARS, Natl Soil Tilth Lab Agr & Environm, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Izaurralde, Cesar] Pacific NW Natl Lab, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Izaurralde, Cesar] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Kemanian, Armen R.; Pravia, Maria Virginia] Penn State Univ, Dept Plant Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Kersebaum, K.

Oxidative extracellular enzymes produced by ectomycorrhizal fungi may aid plant N acquisition by providing access to N in macromolecular complexes. We test the hypotheses that ectomycorrhizal Cortinarius species produce Mn-dependent peroxidases, and that the activity of these enzymes declines at elevated concentrations of inorganic N. In a boreal pine forest and a sub-arctic birch forest, Cortinarius DNA was assessed by 454-sequencing of ITS amplicons and related to Mn-peroxidase activity in humus samples with- and without previous N amendment. Transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes was investigated in field samples. Phylogenetic analyses of Cortinarius peroxidase amplicons and genome sequences were performed. We found a significant co-localization of high peroxidase activity and DNA from Cortinarius species. Peroxidase activity was reduced by high ammonium concentrations. Amplification of mRNA sequences indicated transcription of Cortinarius Mn-peroxidase genes under field conditions. The Cortinarius glaucopus genome encodes 11 peroxidases - a number comparable to many white-rot wood decomposers. These results support the hypothesis that some ectomycorrhizal fungi - Cortinarius species in particular - may play an important role in decomposition of complex organic matter, linked to their mobilization of organically bound N.;"carbon sequestration; Class II peroxidases; decomposition; ectomycorrhizal fungi; high throughput sequencing; nitrogen limitation; priming effect; transcription";"SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; DEGRADING HEME PEROXIDASES; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; BOREAL FOREST; C-14-LABELED LIGNIN; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; NITROGEN; DECOMPOSITION; CARBON; DEGRADATION";Plant & Animal Science;Plant Sciences;"[Bodeker, Inga T.

The analysis is based on simulations with the Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems (POLES) global energy systems model. The phase-out of nuclear power increases GHG emissions by 2% globally and 7% for Annex I countries. The price of certificates increases by 24% and total compliance costs of Annex I countries rise by 28%. Compliance costs increase most for Japan (+58%) and the US (+28%). China, India, and Russia benefit from a global nuclear phase-out because revenues from higher trading volumes of certificates outweigh the costs of losing nuclear power as a mitigation option. Even for countries that face a relatively large increase in compliance costs, such as Japan, the nuclear phase-out implies a relatively small overall economic burden. When trading of certificates is available only to countries that committed to a second Kyoto period, the nuclear phase-out results in a larger increase in the compliance costs for the group of Annex I countries (but not for the EU and Australia). Results from sensitivity analyses suggest that the findings are fairly robust to alternative burden-sharing schemes and emission target levels.Policy relevanceNew calculations show that the impact of a global phase-out of nuclear energy on global mitigation costs is quite modest, but that there are substantial differences for countries. Total compliance costs increase the most for Japan and the US, but these are rather marginal if measured in terms of GDP. China, India, and Russia benefit from a nuclear phase-out because their additional revenues from selling certificates outweigh the additional costs of losing nuclear power as a mitigation option. The findings also highlight the importance of certificate trading to achieving climate targets in a cost-efficient way. If Japan or the US were to be banned from certificate trading, along with other countries, because of their non-participation in a second Kyoto period, then their compliance costs would increase substantially under a nuclear phase-out. The EU, however, would benefit because certificate prices would be lower.;"post-Kyoto; climate policy; nuclear power; Copenhagen pledges; phase-out";"COPENHAGEN ACCORD; SCENARIOS; PLEDGES; MODEL; REDUCTIONS; EMISSIONS; COUNTRIES; POLICIES; ENERGY; WORLD";"Environment/Ecology; Social Sciences";"Environmental Studies; Public Administration";"[Duscha, Vicki; Schleich, Joachim] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Schumacher, Katja] Oko Inst, Berlin Off, D-10179 Berlin, Germany; [Schleich, Joachim] Grenoble Ecole Management, F-38003 Grenoble 01, France; [Schleich, Joachim] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Buisson, Pierre] Enerdata, F-38000 Grenoble, France";Duscha, V (reprint author), Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany.;"France; Germany; United States";"France; Germany; United States";"DEU; FRA; USA";0;CLIMATE POLICY;;;;;14;3;327;352;;10.1080/14693062.2014.852018;1469-3062;1752-7457;;1469-3062 eISSN: 1752-7457;;oui;1;2014;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

Therefore, in addition to the screening and evaluation of the performance of a potential CO2 storage site, risks of unwanted migration in the subsurface should be addressed and adequately managed. This can include the use of methods to mitigate those risks and ultimately to remediate potential adverse effects. This paper reviews the status of knowledge with regards to the mitigation and remediation technologies, from mature techniques adapted from other fields, such as oil and gas industry and environmental clean-up, to research topics offering potential new possibilities. Several categories can be defined: (1) interventions on operational or decommissioned wells to re-establish their integrity; (2) pressure/fluid management techniques for countering the leakage driving forces and/or removing the leaking fluids; (3) emerging technologies providing new mitigation opportunities for controlling undesired CO2 migration; (4) techniques to remediate the impacts potentially induced by such a migration. This technical state of the art is completed by the actual practices in the emerging field of CO2 geological storage established from the regulatory requirements and guidelines, and from the experience gained in existing storage projects over the world. This article concludes on important best practices stemming from this review and on future challenges in terms of research topics and operational needs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study is to analyze the impacts of changes in future temperatures on the heating and cooling services of buildings and the resulting energy and macro-economic effects at global and regional levels. For this purpose, the techno-economic TIAM-WORLD (TIMES Integrated Assessment Model) and the general equilibrium GEMINI-E3 (General Equilibrium Model of International-National Interactions between Economy, Energy and Environment) models are coupled with a climate model, PLASIM-ENTS (Planet-Simulator- Efficient Numerical Terrestrial Scheme). The key results are as follows. At the global level, the climate feedback induced by adaptation of the energy system to heating and cooling is found to be insignificant, partly because heating and cooling-induced changes compensate and partly because they represent a limited share of total final energy consumption. However, significant changes are observed at regional levels, more particularly in terms of additional power capacity required to satisfy additional cooling services, resulting in increases in electricity prices. In terms of macro-economic impacts, welfare gains and losses are associated more with changes in energy exports and imports than with changes in energy consumption for heating and cooling. The rebound effect appears to be non-negligible.

Fossil records demonstrate that organisms surviving such events were often smaller than those before5, 6, a phenomenon called the Lilliput effect(7). Here, we show that two gastropod species adapted to acidified seawater at shallow-water CO2 seeps were smaller than those found in normal pH conditions and had higher mass-specific energy consumption but significantly lower whole-animal metabolic energy demand. These physiological changes allowed the animals to maintain calcification and to partially repair shell dissolution. These observations of the long-term chronic effects of increased CO2 levels forewarn of changes we can expect in marine ecosystems as CO2 emissions continue to rise unchecked, and support the hypothesis that ocean acidification contributed to past extinction events. The ability to adapt through dwarfing can confer physiological advantages as the rate of CO2 emissions continues to increase.;;"END-PERMIAN EXTINCTION; MASS EXTINCTIONS; ACIDIFICATION; RECOVERY; CORAL; CO2; EVENT; SIZE";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Garilli, Vittorio] APEMA Paleosofia Res & Educ Serv, I-90136 Palermo, Italy; [Rodolfo-Metalpa, Riccardo] Inst Rech Dev, UMR ENTROPIE Lab Excellence CORAIL, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Rodolfo-Metalpa, Riccardo] IAEA EL, MC-98000 Monaco, Monaco; [Scuderi, Danilo] Univ Catania, BIOMLG Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, I-95032 Catania, Italy; [Brusca, Lorenzo] INGV, Sez Palermo, I-90146 Palermo, Italy; [Parrinello, Daniela] Univ Palermo, STEBICEF Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Biol Chim & Fa, I-90123 Palermo, Italy; [Rastrick, Samuel P.

Insufficiently cold winters are thought to result in fewer viable flower buds and the subsequent development of fewer fruits or nuts, decreasing the yield of an orchard or fecundity of a species. The best existing approximation for a threshold of sufficient cold accumulation, the chilling requirement of a species or variety, has been quantified by manipulating or modeling the conditions that result in dormant bud breaking. However, the physiological processes that affect budbreak are not the same as those that determine yield. This study sought to test whether budbreak-based chilling thresholds can reasonably approximate the thresholds that affect yield, particularly regarding the potential impacts of climate change on temperate tree crop yields. County-wide yield records for almond (Prunus dulcis), pistachio (Pistacia vera), and walnut (Juglans regia) in the Central Valley of California were compared with 50 years of weather records. Bayesian nonparametric function estimation was used to model yield potentials at varying amounts of chill accumulation. In almonds, average yields occurred when chill accumulation was close to the budbreak-based chilling requirement. However, in the other two crops, pistachios and walnuts, the best previous estimate of the budbreak-based chilling requirements was 19-32 % higher than the chilling accumulations associated with average or above average yields. This research indicates that physiological processes beyond requirements for budbreak should be considered when estimating chill accumulation thresholds of yield decline and potential impacts of climate change.;"Chilling requirement; Climate change; Yield; Bloom; Budbreak; Bayesian";"HEAT REQUIREMENTS; ALMOND CULTIVARS; DYNAMIC-MODEL; FRUIT-TREES; PEACH-TREES; TEMPERATURE; DORMANCY; BUDS; PHENOLOGY; BREAKING";"Biology & Biochemistry; Clinical Medicine; Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Biophysics; Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Physiology";"[Pope, Katherine S.; Brown, Patrick H.; DeJong, Theodore M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95695 USA; [Dose, Volker] EURATOM, Max Planck Inst Plasmaphys, Garching, Germany; [Da Silva, David] INRA, UMR Plant Genet Improvement & Adapt AGAP 1334, F-34060 Montpellier, France";Pope, KS (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, 70 Cottonwood St, Davis, CA 95695 USA.;"France; Germany; United States";"France; Germany; United States";"DEU; FRA; USA";0;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY;;;;;59;6;707;715;;10.1007/s00484-014-0881-x;0020-7128;1432-1254;;0020-7128 eISSN: 1432-1254;;oui;1;2015;non;0;;;;;;3 - Correcte

A reliable and stable atmospheric correction procedure is the basis for ocean colour products of the necessary high quality. In order to guarantee an objective selection from a set of four atmospheric correction processors, the common validation strategy of comparisons between in-situ and satellite-derived water leaving reflectance spectra, is extended by a ranking system. In principle, the statistical parameters such as root mean square error, bias, etc. and measures of goodness of fit, are transformed into relative scores, which evaluate the relationship of quality dependent on the algorithms under study. The sensitivity of these scores to the selected database has been assessed by a bootstrapping exercise, which allows identification of the uncertainty in the scoring results. Although the presented methodology is intended to be used in an algorithm selection process, this paper focusses on the scope of the methodology rather than the properties of the individual processors.

Prior to generating such products, suitable algorithms have to be selected that are appropriate for the purpose. Algorithm selection needs to account for both qualitative and quantitative requirements. In this paper we develop an objective methodology designed to rank the quantitative performance of a suite of bio-optical models. The objective classification is applied using the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset (NOMAD). Using in situ Rrs as input to the models, the performance of eleven semi-analytical models, as well as five empirical chlorophyll algorithms and an empirical diffuse attenuation coefficient algorithm, is ranked for spectrally-resolved IOPs, chlorophyll concentration and the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 489 nm. The sensitivity of the objective classification and the uncertainty in the ranking are tested using a Monte-Carlo approach (bootstrapping). Results indicate that the performance of the semi-analytical models varies depending on the product and wavelength of interest. For chlorophyll retrieval, empirical algorithms perform better than semi-analytical models, in general. The performance of these empirical models reflects either their immunity to scale errors or instrument noise in R data, or simply that the data used for model parameterisation were not independent of NOMAD. Nonetheless, uncertainty in the classification suggests that the performance of some semi-analytical algorithms at retrieving chlorophyll is comparable with the empirical algorithms. For phytoplankton absorption at 443 nm, some semi-analytical models also perform with similar accuracy to an empirical model: We discuss the potential biases, limitations and uncertainty in the approach, as well as additional qualitative considerations for algorithm selection for climate-change studies. Our classification has the potential to be routinely implemented, such that the performance of emerging algorithms can be compared with existing algorithms as they become available. In the long-term, such an approach will further aid algorithm development for ocean-colour studies.

Its initial domestication over 10millennia ago and subsequent wide migration provide striking evidence of adaptation to different environments, agro-ecologies and uses. A bottleneck in the selection of modern varieties has resulted in a reduction in total genetic diversity and a loss of specific alleles relevant to climate-smart agriculture. However, extensive and well-curated collections of landraces, wild barley accessions (H.vulgare ssp. spontaneum) and other Hordeum species exist and are important new allele sources. A wide range of genomic and analytical tools have entered the public domain for exploring and capturing this variation, and specialized populations, mutant stocks and transgenics facilitate the connection between genetic diversity and heritable phenotypes. These lay the biological, technological and informational foundations for developing climate-resilient crops tailored to specific environments that are supported by extensive environmental and geographical databases, new methods for climate modelling and trait/environment association analyses, and decentralized participatory improvement methods. Case studies of important climate-related traits and their constituent genes - including examples that are indicative of the complexities involved in designing appropriate responses - are presented, and key developments for the future highlighted.;"abiotic and biotic stresses; barley genome assembly; evolutionary participatory plant breeding; landraces; niche modelling; wild barley";"SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; POWDERY MILDEW RESISTANCE; VULGARE SUBSP SPONTANEUM; HORDEUM SPECIES POACEAE; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; WILD BARLEY; CULTIVATED BARLEY; GENETIC DIVERSITY; GROWTH HABIT; LEAF RUST";Plant & Animal Science;Plant Sciences;"[Dawson, Ian K.; Russell, Joanne; Thomas, William T.

L.";ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH Volume: 158 Pages: 245-253 Published: 2015;English;Article;In France, the melting level height varies, during the hail season, from about 1 km in the spring to more than 4 km in the summer, and this parameter appears to have a connection with the mean characteristics of hailfalls. In fact, a large 25-year sample of hail size distribution measurements, made with hailpad networks along the southern Atlantic coast, reveals strong correlations between the melting level height and the mean hailstone number in different hailstone diameter ranges. On average, an increase in the melting level height is associated with a decrease in the number of small hailstones (5 to 7 mm diameter), has no apparent effect in the middle range (7 to 9 mm), and is concomitant with an increase in the number of larger hailstones, particularly in the 11 to 21 mm ranges. When the relationships giving the hailstone number in each diameter range as a function of the melting level height are applied to a given hailfall, an increase in the melting level height is then found to go together with changes in the total hailstone number and kinetic energy. From this observation, it is possible to estimate the potential effect of global warming on hailfalls with different hailstone size distributions. The trends in the monthly surface temperature and in the hail day melting level height observed at Bordeaux during the 1988-2012 period and the global warming projections made for the present century suggest that an increase in the melting level height of 500 m is forecast to occur in this region between 2000 and 2040. The consequences of such an increase for a standard hailfall in the region will be a slight decrease (-12%) in the total number of hailstones, and a significant increase (40%) in total kinetic energy, but with no significant change in the hail frequency. This analysis is compared to the already observed increase in hail intensity in the area under study, and to observations, measurements, and numerical models in other parts of the world.

This brief rejoinder provides the balance that is missing from such climate change denial and skepticism studies on climate change and tourism. Recent research provides substantial evidence that reports on anthropogenic climate change are accurate, and that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, including from the tourism industry, play a significant role in climate change. Some positive net effects may be experienced by some destinations in the short-term, but in the long-term all elements of the tourism system will be impacted. The expansion of tourism emissions at a rate greater than efficiency gains means that it is increasingly urgent that the tourism sector acknowledge, accept and respond to climate change. Debate on tourism-related adaptation and mitigation measures is to be encouraged and welcomed. Climate change denial is not. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A wide range of data sets have shown that environmental conditions, such as temperature and marine productivity, affect the distribution and biological processes of these species, and thus the activities of the humans that depend on them. In this special issue, 25 papers arising from the 2nd CLIOTOP symposium, held in Noumea, New Caledonia in February 2013 report the importance of realistic physical descriptions of oceanic processes for climate change projections, demonstrate a wide range of predator responses to historical climate variability, describe new analytical approaches for understanding the physiology, behaviour and trophodynamics, and project future distributions for a range of species. Several contributions discuss the implications for conservation and fisheries and show that resolving ecosystem management challenges and conflicts in the face of climate change is possible, but will require attention by decision-makers to issues that are broader than their traditional mandate. In the coming years, an increased focus on the development of management options to reduce the impacts of climate change on top predators and their dependent industries is needed.

However, ecological factors also have the potential to influence demographic history and thus patterns of genetic variation. In this study, we investigated the impact of past climate, and also the potential impact of host plant species abundance, on intraspecific genetic variation in three codistributed and related specialized solitary bees of the genus Melitta with very similar life history traits and dispersal capacities. We sequenced five independent loci in samples collected from the three species. Our analyses revealed that the species associated with the most abundant host plant species (Melitta leporina) displays unusually high genetic variation, to an extent that is seldom reported in phylogeographic studies of animals and plants. This suggests a potential role of food resource abundance in determining current patterns of genetic variation in specialized herbivorous insects. Patterns of genetic variation in the two other species indicated lower overall levels of diversity, and that M.nigricans could have experienced a recent range expansion. Ecological niche modelling of the three Melitta species and their main host plant species suggested a strong reduction in range size during the last glacial maximum. Comparing observed sequence data with data simulated using spatially explicit models of coalescence suggests that M.leporina recovered a range and population size close to their current levels at the end of the last glaciation, and confirms recent range expansion as the most likely scenario for M.nigricans. Overall, this study illustrates that both demographic history and ecological factors may have contributed to shape current phylogeographic patterns.;"coalescent simulations; demographic history; food specialization; intraspecific diversity; phylogeography; phytophagous insects; population fragmentation";"Y-CHROMOSOME DISTRIBUTIONS; CENTRAL-ASIAN PASTORALISTS; DNA-SEQUENCES; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; NUCLEAR GENES; COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; HYMENOPTERA COLLETIDAE; RECOMBINANT SEQUENCES; BALANCING SELECTION; MOSAIC STRUCTURE";"Biology & Biochemistry; Environment/Ecology; Molecular Biology & Genetics; Plant & Animal Science";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";"[Dellicour, Simon; Mardulyn, Patrick] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Evolutionary Biol & Ecol, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Michez, Denis] Univ Mons, Res Inst Biosci, Zool Lab, B-7000 Mons, Belgium; [Rasplus, Jean-Yves] Montpellier SupAgro, Cirad, IRD, UMR CBGP,INRA, Montferrier Sur Lez, France";Dellicour, S (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.;"Belgium; France; United Kingdom";"Belgium; France; United Kingdom";"BEL; FRA; GBR";0;MOLECULAR ECOLOGY;;;;;24;5;1074;1090;;10.1111/mec.13085;0962-1083;1365-294X;;0962-1083 eISSN: 1365-294X;;oui;1;2015;non;0;;;;;;5 - Exceptionelle

The aim was to determine (CH4) and (N2O) emissions from beef cattle feedlot manure in Brazil using the IPCC United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change approach and present a framework that structures priority research for decreasing uncertainties and assessing mitigation scenarios. The analysis consisted of the use of specific farm-scale activity data applied to the 2006 (IPCC) guideline equations for animal manure management updated with specific parameters for Brazil conditions. Uncertainties were assessed by error-propagation technique. The results indicated that 376.6 GgCO(2)eq were emitted from the manure management of beef cattle feedlots in Brazil in 2010. Nitrous oxide accounted for 61 % of total emissions, out of which 69 % came from direct emissions. Uncertainties were high, comprising -30 to +80 %. Solid storage-heap and field application were the largest sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (81 % of total emissions) and held most of the variance in uncertainties. Although, due to limitations in the IPCC methodology for integrating GHG emissions at farm-scale, we could not account for emissions occurring from different lengths of time in each manure management compartment prior to field application. As a consequence, this GHG inventory lacks consistence. The use of more robust methodologies such as process-based models are recommended for improvements, however they are currently unavailable because there is a lack of key data for Brazil conditions for validating those models. Our literature revision shows that the most effective research for raising those data would track emissions from manure: generated from male Nellore (Bos Indicus) cattle fed for 90 days with a high-energy diet, removed only at the end of feeding period and held in heaps over 60 days before being applied to maize (Zea mays L.) cropping fields under clay soil. The proposed research and methodology approaches described in this work is required to establish a manure management emission assessment that will become more responsive to the changing practices on Brazilian beef cattle feedlots and, consequently, permitting implication of mitigation scenarios to be ascertained.;"Animal manure; Activity data; Emission assessment; Methane; Nitrous oxide";"GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; AGRICULTURE; SYSTEMS; CARBON";Environment/Ecology;Environmental Sciences;"[Costa Junior, C.; Cerri, C.

This model has dominated thinking in developmental epigenetics over recent decades. Recent re-analyses of the model show that demethylation of the paternally derived genome is more modest than formerly thought and results in overall similar levels of methylation of the paternal and maternal pronuclei in presyngamal zygotes, although there is little evidence for a pervasive process of passive demethylation during the cleavage stage of development. In contrast, the inner cell mass of the blastocyst shows some loss of methylation within specific classes of loci. Improved methods of chemical analysis now allow global base-level analysis of modifications to CpG dinucleotides within the cells of the early embryo, yet the low cost and convenience of the immunolocalisation techniques mean that they still have a valuable place in the analysis of the epigenetics of embryo development.

Based on the known distribution and ecology of C. imicola, the species' response to monthly climatic conditions was characterised using CLIMEX with 109 spatial resolution climatic datasets. The species' climatic niche was projected worldwide and under future climatic scenarios. The validated model highlights the role of irrigation in supporting the occurrence of C. imicola in arid regions. In Europe, the modelled potential distribution of C. imicola extended further West than its reported distribution, raising questions regarding ongoing process of colonization and non-climatic habitat factors. The CLIMEX model highlighted similar ecological niches for C. imicola and the Australasian C. brevitarsis raising questions on biogeography and biosecurity. Under the climate change scenarios considered, its' modelled potential distribution could expand northward in the Northern hemisphere, whereas in Africa its range may contract in the future. The biosecurity risks from bluetongue and African horse sickness viruses need to be re-evaluated in regions where the vector's niche is suitable. Under a warmer climate, the risk of vector-borne epizootic pathogens such as bluetongue and African horse sickness viruses are likely to increase as the climate suitability for C. imicola shifts poleward, especially in Western Europe.;;"CLIMATE-CHANGE; BITING MIDGES; DIPTERA-CERATOPOGONIDAE; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; SATELLITE IMAGERY; EUROPE; TEMPERATURE; AUSTRALIA; MODELS; MAP";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Guichard, Sylvain; Tran, Annelise] Cirad, UR AGIRs, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Guichard, Sylvain; Kriticos, Darren J.] Univ Minnesota, InSTePP, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Guis, Helene; Garros, Claire; Balenghien, Thomas] Cirad, UMR CMAEE, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Guis, Helene; Garros, Claire; Balenghien, Thomas] INRA, CMAEE UMR1309, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Tran, Annelise] Cirad, TETIS UMR15, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Kriticos, Darren J.] CSIRO, Agr Flagship & Biosecur Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia";Kriticos, DJ (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, InSTePP, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.;"Australia; France; United States";"Australia; France; United States";"AUS; FRA; USA";2;PLOS ONE;;;;;9;11;;;e112491;10.1371/journal.pone.0112491;1932-6203;;;1932-6203;;oui;1;2014;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

Here, we investigated the signature of local adaptation over a short spatial scale using 96 European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) individuals originating from two pairs of populations on the northern and southern slopes of Mont Ventoux (south-eastern France). We performed both single and multilocus analysis of selection based on 53 climate-related candidate genes containing 546 SNPs. F-ST outlier methods at the SNP level revealed a weak signal of selection, with three marginally significant outliers in the northern populations. At the gene level, considering haplotypes as alleles, two additional marginally significant outliers were detected, one on each slope. To account for the uncertainty of haplotype inference, we averaged the Bayes factors over many possible phase reconstructions. Epistatic selection offers a realistic multilocus model of selection in natural populations. Here, we used a test suggested by Ohta based on the decomposition of the variance of linkage disequilibrium. Overall populations, 0.23% of the SNP pairs (haplotypes) showed evidence of epistatic selection, with nearly 80% of them being within genes. One of the between gene epistatic selection signals arose between an F-ST outlier and a nonsynonymous mutation in a drought response gene. Additionally, we identified haplotypes containing selectively advantageous allele combinations which were unique to high or low elevations and northern or southern populations.

Such movements involve annually recurring travel over long distances usually triggered by seasonal changes in the environment. Often, the migration is associated with travel to or from reproduction areas to regions of growth. Young anadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) emigrate from freshwater nursery areas during spring and early summer to feed and grow in the North Atlantic Ocean. The transition from the freshwater (parr') stage to the migratory stage where they descend streams and enter salt water (smolt') is characterized by morphological, physiological and behavioural changes where the timing of this parr-smolt transition is cued by photoperiod and water temperature. Environmental conditions in the freshwater habitat control the downstream migration and contribute to within- and among-river variation in migratory timing. Moreover, the timing of the freshwater emigration has likely evolved to meet environmental conditions in the ocean as these affect growth and survival of the post-smolts. Using generalized additive mixed-effects modelling, we analysed spatio-temporal variations in the dates of downstream smolt migration in 67 rivers throughout the North Atlantic during the last five decades and found that migrations were earlier in populations in the east than the west. After accounting for this spatial effect, the initiation of the downstream migration among rivers was positively associated with freshwater temperatures, up to about 10 degrees C and levelling off at higher values, and with sea-surface temperatures. Earlier migration occurred when river discharge levels were low but increasing. On average, the initiation of the smolt seaward migration has occurred 2.5days earlier per decade throughout the basin of the North Atlantic. This shift in phenology matches changes in air, river, and ocean temperatures, suggesting that Atlantic salmon emigration is responding to the current global climate changes.;"Atlantic salmon; freshwater conditions; North Atlantic; phenology; sea surface temperature; smolt emigration";"FRESH-WATER ENVIRONMENT; SMOLT MIGRATION; BROWN TROUT; RIVER IMSA; MARINE SURVIVAL; PACIFIC SALMON; POST-SMOLTS; TEMPERATURE; SEA; POPULATION";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Otero, Jaime; Storvik, Geir O.; Stenseth, Nils C.; Vollestad, Leif Asbjorn] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [L'Abee-Lund, Jan Henning] Norwegian Water & Energy Directorate, N-0301 Oslo, Norway; [Castro-Santos, Ted; Letcher, Benjamin H.; Horton, Gregg] US Geol Survey, Silvio O Conte Anadromous Fish Res Ctr, Biol Resources Div, Turners Falls, MA 01376 USA; [Leonardsson, Kjell; Lundqvist, Hans] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies SLU, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Storvik, Geir O.] Univ Oslo, Dept Math, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Jonsson, Bror; Jonsson, Nina] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Dempson, Brian] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, St John, NF A1C 5X1, Canada; [Russell, Ian C.] Cefas Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England; [Jensen, Arne J.; Hvidsten, Nils A.; Naesje, Tor F.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Bagliniere, Jean-Luc] INRA, Agrocampus Ouest, UMR 0985, ESE, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Dionne, Melanie] Minist Dev Durable Environm Faune & Parcs Quebec, Direct Faune Aquat, Ste Foy, PQ, Canada; [Romakkaniemi, Atso; Erkinaro, Jaakko; Niemela, Eero] Univ Oulu, Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Kocik, John F.; Music, Paul A.] Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Maine Field Stn, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Orono, ME 04473 USA; [Poole, Russell; Rogan, Ger; Dillane, Mary] Inst Marine, Fisheries Ecosyst Advisory Serv, Newport, Mayo, Ireland; [Jokikokko, Erkki] Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, Bothnian Bay Fisheries Res Stn, FI-94450 Keminmaa, Finland; [Arnekleiv, Jo Vegar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Sect Nat Hist, Museum Nat Hist & Archaeol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Kennedy, Richard J.] Agrifood & Biosci Inst, Belfast BT9 5PX, Antrim, North Ireland; [Caballero, Pablo] Conselleria Medio Rural Xunta Galicia, Secc Biodiversidade, Serv Conservac Nat Pontevedra, Pontevedra 36071, Spain; [Antonsson, Thorolfur; Gudjonsson, Sigurdur; Arnason, Fridthjofur; Jonsson, Ingi R.] Inst Freshwater Fisheries, IS-112 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Veselov, Alexey E.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Biol, Karelian Res Ctr, Petrozavodsk 185910, Russia; [Lamberg, Anders] Vilt & Fiskeinfo AS, N-7054 Ranheim, Norway; [Groom, Steve; Taylor, Benjamin H.; Taberner, Malcolm] Plymouth Marine Lab, Remote Sensing Grp, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England; [Skaala, Oystein] Inst Marine Res, N-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Saegrov, Harald] Radgivende Biologer AS, N-5003 Bergen, Norway; [Stenseth, Nils C.] Inst Marine Res, Flodevigen Marine Res Stn, N-4817 His, Norway";Otero, J (reprint author), CSIC, Inst Invest Marinas, Eduardo Cabello 6, Vigo 36208, Spain.;"Canada; Finland; France; Iceland; Ireland; Norway; Russia; Spain; Sweden; United Kingdom; United States";"Canada; Finland; France; Iceland; Ireland; Norway; Russia; Spain; Sweden; United Kingdom; United States";"CAN; ESP; FIN; FRA; GBR; IRL; ISL; NOR; RUS; SWE; USA";8;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;20;1;61;75;;10.1111/gcb.12363;1354-1013;1365-2486;;1354-1013 eISSN: 1365-2486;;oui;1;2014;non;0;;;;;;5 - Exceptionelle

The study investigated the plant water relations, cambial activity and wood formation in black spruce saplings [Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] subjected to water deficit and warming. Four-year-old saplings growing in three greenhouses were submitted to different thermal conditions: T0, with a temperature equal to the external air temperature; and T + 2 and T + 5, with temperatures set at 2 and 5 K higher than T0, respectively. We also submitted saplings to two irrigation regimes and studied the effects of a water deficit of 32 days in May-June. We evaluated plant water relations, cambial activity, wood formation and anatomical characteristics from May to October 2010. Lower needle physiology rates were observed during water deficit, with 20-day suspension of irrigation, but after re-watering, non-irrigated saplings attained the same values as irrigated ones in all thermal conditions. Significant differences between irrigation regimes were detected in cambial activity at the end of the water deficit and after resumption of irrigation. Under warmer conditions, the recovery of non-irrigated saplings was slower than T0 and they needed from 2 to 4 weeks to completely restore cambial activity. No significant differences in wood anatomy were observed between irrigation regimes, but there was a sporadic effect on wood density under warming. During wood formation, the warmer conditions combined with water deficit increased sapling mortality by 5 and 12.2% for T + 2 and T + 5, respectively. The black spruce saplings that survived were more sensitive to water availability, and the restoration of cambial activity was slower at temperatures higher than T0. Our results suggest that black spruce showed a plastic response to intense water deficit under warming, but this would compromise their survival.";"cambial activity; needle water relations; saplings; thermal conditions; water deficit; wood formation";"BLACK SPRUCE SEEDLINGS; INTRAANNUAL DENSITY-FLUCTUATIONS; AIR-SLIT CONTAINERS; TREE MORTALITY; BALSAM FIR; NORWAY SPRUCE; EUCALYPTUS-PAUCIFLORA; CRYPTOMERIA-JAPONICA; DROUGHT RESPONSE; XYLEM PHENOLOGY";Plant & Animal Science;Forestry;"[Balducci, Lorena; Deslauriers, Annie; Rossi, Sergio] Univ Quebec Chicoutimi, Dept Sci Fondament, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada; [Giovannelli, Alessio] IVaLSA CNR, Lab Xilogenesi, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, FI, Italy; [Rathgeber, Cyrille B.

Cladocora caespitosa, the sole zooxanthellate scleractinian reef-builder in the Mediterranean, is among the organisms affected by these episodes. Extensive bioconstructions of this endemic coral are very rare at the present time and are threatened by several stressors. In this study, we assessed the long-term response of this temperate coral to warming sea-water in the Columbretes Islands (NW Mediterranean) and described, for the first time, the relationship between recurrent mortality events and local sea surface temperature (SST) regimes in the Mediterranean Sea. A water temperature series spanning more than 20 years showed a summer warming trend of 0.06 degrees C per year and an increased frequency of positive thermal anomalies. Mortality resulted from tissue necrosis without massive zooxanthellae loss and during the 11-year study, necrosis was recorded during nine summers separated into two mortality periods (2003-2006 and 2008-2012). The highest necrosis rates were registered during the first mortality period, after the exceptionally hot summer of 2003. Although necrosis and temperature were significantly associated, the variability in necrosis rates during summers with similar thermal anomalies pointed to other acting factors. In this sense, our results showed that these differences were more closely related to the interannual temperature context and delayed thermal stress after extreme summers, rather than to acclimatisation and adaption processes.;;"MASS MORTALITY EVENTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CORAL-REEFS; OCULINA-PATAGONICA; EUNICELLA-SINGULARIS; ENVIRONMENTAL-STRESS; BENTHIC COMMUNITIES; SOLAR-RADIATION; ANDAMAN SEA; SUMMER 1999";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Kersting, Diego K.; Linares, Cristina] Univ Barcelona, Dept Ecol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Bensoussan, Nathaniel] SCOPArl, IPSO FACTO, Marseille, France";Kersting, DK (reprint author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Ecol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.;"France; Spain";"France; Spain";"ESP; FRA";10;PLOS ONE;;;;;8;8;;;e70820;10.1371/journal.pone.0070820;1932-6203;;;1932-6203;;oui;1;2013;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

A popular rice hybrid (IR75217H), a heat-tolerant check (N22), and a mega-variety (IR64) were tested for tolerance of seed-set and grain quality to high-temperature stress at anthesis at ambient and elevated [CO2]. Under an ambient air temperature of 29 degrees C (tissue temperature 28.3 degrees C), elevated [CO2] increased vegetative and reproductive growth, including seed yield in all three genotypes. Seed-set was reduced by high temperature in all three genotypes, with the hybrid and IR64 equally affected and twice as sensitive as the tolerant cultivar N22. No interaction occurred between temperature and [CO2] for seed-set. The hybrid had significantly more anthesed spikelets at all temperatures than IR64 and at 29 degrees C this resulted in a large yield advantage. At 35 degrees C (tissue temperature 32.9 degrees C) the hybrid had a higher seed yield than 11464 due to the higher spikelet number, but at 38 degrees C (tissue temperature 34-35 degrees C) there was no yield advantage. Grain gel consistency in the hybrid and IR64 was reduced by high temperatures only at elevated [CO2], while the percentage of broken grains increased from 10% at 29 degrees C to 35% at 38 degrees C in the hybrid. It is concluded that seed-set of hybrids is susceptible to short episodes of high temperature during anthesis, but that at intermediate tissue temperatures of 32.9 degrees C higher spikelet number (yield potential) of the hybrid can compensate to some extent. If the heat tolerance from N22 or other tolerant donors could be transferred into hybrids, yield could be maintained under the higher temperatures predicted with climate change.;"Elevated CO2; flowering; grain quality; high temperature; rice; spikelet fertility";"ORYZA-SATIVA L.; SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM; ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; ENRICHMENT FACE; SPIKELET FERTILITY; SEASONAL-CHANGES; NIGHT TEMPERATURE; FIELD CONDITIONS; STARCH SYNTHASE; HEAT TOLERANCE";Plant & Animal Science;Plant Sciences;"[Madan, P.; Jagadish, S.

The method consists in searching for a smooth temporal pattern in the observations. This pattern can be either the response of the climate system to a specific forcing or to a combination of forcings. Many characteristics of this new method are different from those of the classical optimal fingerprint method. It allows to infer the spatial distribution of the detected signal, without providing any spatial guess pattern. The spatial properties of the internal climate variability doesn't need to be estimated either. The estimation of such quantities being very challenging at regional scale, the proposed method is particularly well-suited for such scale. The efficiency of the method is illustrated by applying it on real homogenized datasets of temperatures and precipitation over France. A multimodel detection is performed in both cases, using an ensemble of atmosphere-ocean general circulation models for estimating the temporal patterns. Regarding temperatures, new results are highlighted, especially by showing that a change is detected even after removing the uniform part of the warming. The sensitivity of the method is discussed in this case, relatively to the computation of the temporal patterns and to the choice of the model. The method also allows to detect a climate change signal in precipitation. This change impacts the spatial distribution of the precipitation more than the mean over the domain. The ability of the method to provide an estimate of the spatial distribution of the change following the prescribed temporal patterns is also illustrated.;"Climate change; Anthropogenic forcing; Detection; Attribution; Statistical test; Splines";"20TH-CENTURY TEMPERATURE-CHANGE; SURFACE; ATTRIBUTION";Geosciences;Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences;"[Ribes, Aurelien; Planton, Serge] Meteo France CNRS, CNRM GAME, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Azais, Jean-Marc] Univ Toulouse, UPS, IMT, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France";Ribes, A (reprint author), Meteo France CNRS, CNRM GAME, 42 Av G Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse, France.;France;France;FRA;14;CLIMATE DYNAMICS;;;;;35;2-3;391;406;;10.1007/s00382-009-0670-0;0930-7575;;;0930-7575;;non;0;;oui;1;2010;"Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), URA1357; Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse (IMT), UMR5219";"Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), UMR3589; Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse (IMT), UMR5219";"UMR5219; URA1357";"UMR3589; UMR5219";4 - Excellente

Correlation between sedimentary archives revealed the main sedimentary infilling phases during the last 6000 years. Four units (U1-U4) are recognized in the coastal sediment wedge of the system, corresponding to the stepwise marine invasion of the bay. We show that (1) marine inundation, due to the steep morphology of the bedrock, is diachronous between distal and proximal records. A time lag of similar to 1000 years is inferred over a distance of less than 5 km: (2) in the outer areas, the sedimentation has been condensed since 3000 years; (3) proximal estuarine archives offer the best record of sedimentary processes covering the last 2000 years, including the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). Correlations in proximal records in the Bay of Vilaine assess the connection between coastal sedimentary dynamics, climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities during the MWP. We match the preservation of clay deposits to increased river-borne suspended matter transported to the estuary probably as a result of accelerated land-use development (higher soil erosion) in the catchment area between ca. 880 and 1050 AD. Because the preservation of estuarine sedimentary successions is favoured when coastal wave sediment reworking is minimal, it is proposed that the prevailing climatic regime in south Brittany during the MWP likely resembled to that of the preferred negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Our data are fairly consistent with other late Holocene records from northern Europe including the Atlantic seaboard. However, they outline the difficulty in interpreting climatic and anthropogenic signatures in coastal sedimentary records where high-resolution chronologies required to unravel their respective influences are still missing.

The catchment (29 km(2)), mainly formed of limestones and marls, is located in an area rich in archaeological sites in the Massif Central. The respective impacts of human activities and climate on SY were compared by quantification of human settlements through archaeological survey and palynological data. During the Lateglacial and early Holocene up to about 7500 yr cal. BP, variations in SSY and DSY rates were mainly related to climate change with higher rates during colder periods (Younger Dryas and Preboreal) and lower rates during warmer periods (Bolling-Allerod and Boreal). However, CF1 tephra fallout induced a sharp increase in SY during the Allerod. During the middle and late Holocene after 7500 yr cal. BP, SSY and DSY greatly increased (by factors of 6.5 and 2.8, respectively), particularly during the Final Neolithic at about 5300 yr cal. BP when the climate became cooler and more humid. After this date, at least 75% of the SSY increase and more than 90% of the DSY increase resulted from human activities, but SSY rates showed little variation during Protohistoric and Historic Times up to the seventeenth century. SSY and DSY rates and DSY/SSY ratio indicate that catchment soils began to form during the Lateglacial and Preboreal, thickened considerably during the Boreal and Atlantic, finally thinning (rejuvenation) mainly as the result of human-induced erosion during the sub-Boreal and sub-Atlantic. Increased mechanical erosion during the late Holocene also induced an increase in chemical erosion.;"archaeological survey; climate-change impact; French Massif Central; Holocene; land-use impact; Lateglacial; palaeolake; soil erosion; solid and dissolved sediment yield";"GREENLAND ICE-CORE; PUY-DE-DOME; RESTRICTED ENVIRONMENT; LACUSTRINE SEDIMENTS; HOLOCENE PERIODS; LAKE-SEDIMENTS; RIVER SEDIMENT; YOUNGER-DRYAS; DENUDATION; EROSION";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary";"[Macaire, Jean-Jacques] Univ Orleans, Univ Tours, Fac Sci & Tech, UMR ISTO 6113,INSU,CNRS, F-37200 Tours, France; [Argant, Jacqueline] Univ Lyon 1, UMR 6636, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Trement, Frederic] Univ Clermont Ferrand, EA 1001, F-63006 Clermont Ferrand, France";Macaire, JJ (reprint author), Univ Orleans, Univ Tours, Fac Sci & Tech, UMR ISTO 6113,INSU,CNRS, Ave Monge, F-37200 Tours, France.;France;France;FRA;10;HOLOCENE;;;;;20;4;497;516;;10.1177/0959683609355181;0959-6836;;;0959-6836;;non;0;;oui;1;2010;"Institut des Sciences de la Terre d'Orléans (ISTO), UMR6113; Laboratoire méditerranéen de préhistoire Europe-Afrique (LAMPEA), UMR6636";"Institut des Sciences de la Terre d'Orléans (ISTO), UMR7327; Laboratoire méditerranéen de préhistoire Europe-Afrique (LAMPEA), UMR7269";"UMR6113; UMR6636";"UMR7269; UMR7327";3 - Correcte

Tanya; David, Jean-Francois; Haettenschwiler, Stephan";OECOLOGIA Volume: 163 Issue: 1 Pages: 247-256 Published: 2010;English;Article;Increasing atmospheric CO(2) and temperature are predicted to alter litter decomposition via changes in litter chemistry and environmental conditions. The extent to which these predictions are influenced by biotic factors such as litter species composition or decomposer activity, and in particular how these different factors interact, is not well understood. In a 5-week laboratory experiment we compared the decomposition of leaf litter from four temperate tree species (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea, Carpinus betulus and Tilia platyphyllos) in response to four interacting factors: elevated CO(2)-induced changes in litter quality, a 3A degrees C warmer environment during decomposition, changes in litter species composition, and presence/absence of a litter-feeding millipede (Glomeris marginata). Elevated CO(2) and temperature had much weaker effects on decomposition than litter species composition and the presence of Glomeris. Mass loss of elevated CO(2)-grown leaf litter was reduced in Fagus and increased in Fagus/Tilia mixtures, but was not affected in any other leaf litter treatment. Warming increased litter mass loss in Carpinus and Tilia, but not in the other two litter species and in none of the mixtures. The CO(2)- and temperature-related differences in decomposition disappeared completely when Glomeris was present. Overall, fauna activity stimulated litter mass loss, but to different degrees depending on litter species composition, with a particularly strong effect on Fagus/Tilia mixtures (+58%). Higher fauna-driven mass loss was not followed by higher C mineralization over the relatively short experimental period. Apart from a strong interaction between litter species composition and fauna, the tested factors had little or no interactive effects on decomposition. We conclude that if global change were to result in substantial shifts in plant community composition and macrofauna abundance in forest ecosystems, these interacting biotic factors could have greater impacts on decomposition and biogeochemical cycles than rising atmospheric CO(2) concentration and temperature.;"Elevated carbon dioxide; Litter diversity; Litter quality; Saprophagous macrofauna; Temperature";"AIR CO2 ENRICHMENT; ELEVATED CO2; GLOMERIS-MARGINATA; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; SPECIES RICHNESS; SOIL; QUALITY; RATES";Environment/Ecology;Ecology;"[Rouifed, Soraya; Handa, I.

Glacially polished bedrock outcrops are offset by right-lateral strike-slip faults. Gravitational structures appear to be spatially connected to these active faults. Dating using the in situ-produced (10)Be cosmogenic nuclide performed on glacial, tectonic and gravity surfaces. The late glacial-interglacial Holocene transition is constrained by (10)Be ages between 12 and 15 ka obtained on glacially polished surfaces. The main tectonic activity closely post-dates the main deglaciation event and is constrained by (10)Be ages of 11 and 7-8 ka obtained on fault scarps. Three successive periods of landsliding are recognized, at 11-12, 7-9 and 2.5-5.5 ka. These Holocene ages were obtained on right-lateral strike-slip fault scarps indicating that recent Alpine tectonics are expressed by transcurrent movements. The discussed close age relationship between deglaciation and a tectonic pulse may suggest that post-glacial rebound and enhanced pore water pressure do influence seismogenic tectonic activity. Gravitational destabilizations at 11-12 and 7-9 ka are coincidental with the main tectonic activity, and suggest tectonic shaking as a landslide trigger. The third gravitational destabilization at 2.5-5.5 ka could be attributed either to slope weakness resulting from multiple low-magnitude earthquake events, as currently revealed by the seismic activity or to climatic causes during the wetter optimum climatic period. These early and middle Holocene ages coincide with a phase of large landslide throughout the Alps scale which suggests that these large gravitational mass movements could be related to combined effects of intense tectonic activity and transitions form cold and dry period to warm and wetter phase.

We produced spatial reconstructions of the monthly evolutions of temperature, precipitation and water discharge in 15 watersheds of six coastal river basins and examined the major changes based on trend analysis for the last 40 years. In this part of the Mediterranean, the general warming trend was strongly enhanced by changes in the atmospheric circulation patterns, characterized by a northward extension of the subtropical high pressure domain during spring and summer. During these seasons, monthly warming rates could achieve almost twice the mean annual warming rates. Although annual precipitation did not follow clear trends, water discharge significantly decreased in one third of the watersheds and accounted for an estimated 20% reduction of the water resources in this region. This concerns both the highest and lowest watersheds. In the former, the reduction is likely the result of a temperature induced switch of snowfall to rainfall at high altitudes. In the latter, the reduction of discharge seems to come from lower groundwater levels, which may be related to the temperature increase too, but also have other origins. The recent climatic evolution is consistent with most modelling simulations for the future, indicating that the reduction of the water resources will hold on, probably still enhanced by decreases in precipitation.;;"NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; TIME-SERIES; TRENDS; WATER; PRECIPITATION; STREAMFLOW; RAINFALL; EUROPE";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Lespinas, Franck; Ludwig, Wolfgang; Heussner, Serge] Univ Perpignan, CNRS, UMR 5110, Cefrem, F-66860 Perpignan, France";Lespinas, F (reprint author), Univ Perpignan, CNRS, UMR 5110, Cefrem, 52 Ave Paul Alduy, F-66860 Perpignan, France.;France;France;FRA;21;CLIMATIC CHANGE;;;;;99;3-4;425;456;;10.1007/s10584-009-9668-1;0165-0009;1573-1480;;0165-0009 eISSN: 1573-1480;;non;0;;oui;1;2010;Centre de formation et de recherche sur les environnements méditerranéens (CEFREM), UMR5110;Centre de formation et de recherche sur les environnements méditerranéens (CEFREM), UMR5110;UMR5110;UMR5110;4 - Excellente

Direct radiative forcing is the most studied mechanism. Other much weaker mechanisms, however, can have a significant leverage, but the underlying physics is often poorly known. We review the main mechanisms by which solar variability may impact the terrestrial atmosphere on time scales ranging from days to millennia. This includes radiative forcing, but also the effect of interplanetary perturbations and energetic particle fluxes, all of which are eventually driven by the solar magnetic field.

The resulting hydrological scenarios agree on a marked depletion of water resources during the 21(st) century with an annual mean decrease in both water table level and river discharge. At the seasonal scale, the reduction of river flow is more marked on low than on high flows, the decrease of which is also less robust. The response of extreme flows is even more contrasted, with a decrease of low-flow quantiles, whereas high-flow quantiles would not change significantly. In the Beauce region, one of the hotspots for irrigation in Europe, we show that the increase in potential demand for irrigation would have a lesser impact on water resources than the decrease in groundwater recharge directly caused by climate change, which is enough in itself to threaten the reliability of water resources.;"Climate change; hydrological impacts; statistical downscaling; extreme events; irrigation; uncertainties";"MODEL; BASIN";"Computer Science; Engineering; Environment/Ecology";"Computer Science, Information Systems; Water Resources";"[Ducharne, A.; Habets, F.; Gascoin, S.; Hachour, A.; Oudin, L.] CNRS UPMC, UMR Sisyphe, F-75005 Paris, France";Ducharne, A (reprint author), CNRS UPMC, UMR Sisyphe, UPMC Case 105,4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France.;France;France;FRA;0;PROCEEDINGS OF THE XVIII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN WATER RESOURCES (CMWR 2010);;18th International Conference on Computational Methods in Water Resources (CMWR);JUN 21-24, 2010;Barcelona, SPAIN;;;243;250;;;;;978-84-96736-93-1;;18th International Conference on Computational Methods in Water Resources (CMWR) Date: JUN 21-24, 2010 Location: Barcelona, SPAIN;non;0;;oui;1;2010;Milieux Environnementaux, Transferts et Interactions dans les hydrosystèmes et les Sols (METIS), UMR7619;Milieux Environnementaux, Transferts et Interactions dans les hydrosystèmes et les Sols (METIS), UMR7619;UMR7619;UMR7619;0 - Sans notoriété

An 8.4 m long sediment core was recovered in the Pertuis Charentais (western France). An accurate C-14 Bayesian age model was developed to perform a depth to time conversion of high-resolution sedimentological data obtained on the core. Forest loss and precipitation changes that occurred on the related catchments were reconstructed from data gathered in the literature. A sharp increase in winter rainfall (1700-1750 AD) intensified erosion of catchments previously sensitised by increased forest loss (1640-1710 AD), which resulted in a massive supply of silt to the coast from ca. 1775 AD onwards. A review of articles reporting similar mud layers is also proposed. Depending on their age, some major phases of mankind migration history could be traced back, which confirms the predominant influence of human activities on the siltation of river-influenced coastal environments. We therefore propose to group these mud layers into the Anthropogenic System Tracts, in reference to widely used sequence stratigraphy nomenclature, and we suggest that it might help to identify a Holocene to Anthropocene stratigraphic boundary in coastal areas.

Focusing on six dominant European tree species, the aims of this study were (i) to examine the accuracy of different leaf phenology models to simulate the onset and ending of the leafy season, with particular emphasis on the putative role of chilling to release winter bud dormancy and (ii) to predict seasonal shifts for the 21st century in response to climate warming. Models testing and validation were done for each species considering 2 or 3 years of phenological observations acquired over a large elevational gradient (1500 m range, 57 populations). Flushing models were either based solely on forcing temperatures (1-phase models) or both on chilling and forcing temperatures (2-phases models). Leaf senescence models were based on both temperature and photoperiod. We show that most flushing models are able to predict accurately the observed flushing dates. The 1-phase models are as efficient as 2-phases models for most species suggesting that chilling temperatures are currently sufficient to fully release bud dormancy. However, our predictions for the 21st century highlight that chilling temperature could be insufficient for some species at low elevation. Overall, flushing is expected to advance in the next decades but this trend substantially differed between species (from 0 to 2.4 days per decade). The prediction of leaf senescence appears more challenging, as the proposed models work properly for only two out of four deciduous species, for which senescence is expected to be delayed in the future (from 1.4 to 2.3 days per decade). These trends to earlier spring leafing and later autumn senescence are likely to affect the competitive balance between species. For instance, simulations over the 21st century predict a stronger lengthening of the canopy duration for Quercus petraea than for Fagus sylvatica. suggesting that shifts in the elevational distributions of these species might occur.

Indeed, rivers bear witness to the health of their drainage basins, which justifies integrated basin management. However, this vision should not mask two other aspects of the protection of aquatic and riparian biodiversity as well as services provided by rivers. First, although largely depending on the ecological properties of the surrounding terrestrial environment, rivers are ecological systems by themselves, characterized by their linearity: they are organized in connected networks, complex and ever changing, open to the sea. Second, the structure and functions of river networks respond to manipulations of their hydrology, and are particularly vulnerable to climatic variations. Whatever the scale considered, river networks represent hotlines for sharing water between ecological and societal systems, as well as for preserving both systems in the face of global change. River hotlines are characterized by spatial as well as temporal legacies: every human impact to a river network may be transmitted far downstream from its point of origin, and may produce effects only after a more or less prolonged latency period. Here, I review some of the current issues of river ecology in light of the linear character of river networks. (C) 2011 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Indoor and industrial applications of photocatalysis to remove local air pollutants from the atmosphere are now numerous. Large scale outdoor applications of photocatalysis started with self-cleaning glass, coatings and paints for buildings, and several outdoor experiments have been documented regarding the photocatalytic reduction of NOx levels in urban environment, such as tunnels, streets and highways. The potential applications of photocatalysis, to remove or mitigate a wide range of global warming contributors from the atmosphere, seem an attractive method to help fighting climate change. By harnessing solar energy, photocatalytic processes consume less energy than conventional methods. This review article shows that photocatalysis may be applied successfully to eliminate or transform of all major long-lived well mixed greenhouse gases, but also soot and tropospheric ozone and other short-lived climate forcers. The cases of sulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For ectotherms, such as insect parasitoids, the ability to remain active under extreme climatic conditions is a significant key to fitness. The body size of individuals, and in particular their surface to volume ratio, may play a role in their resistance to thermal conditions. The thermal tolerances are investigated of two closely-related sympatric parasitoid species [Aphidius avenae Haliday and Aphidius rhopalosiphi De Stefani-Perez (Hymenoptera: Aphidiinae)] that have a similar ecology but differ in body size and phenologies. The critical thermal limits of individuals are assessed in both sexes of each parasitoid species and the influence of surface volume ratios on their thermal tolerances. Aphidius avenae is less resistant to low temperatures and more resistant to high temperatures than A. rhopalosiphi. The lower surface to volume ratio of A. avenae individuals may help them to remain active in summer when experiencing heat waves. However, body size is not the sole factor that plays a role in differences of thermal tolerance between species and body size may not be an adaptation to extreme temperatures but rather a by-product of developmental regulation. Closely-related sympatric species from the same ecological guild can have different thermal tolerances that may allow them to occur within the same habitat. The present study also highlights the importance of clearly defining how to measure critical thermal limits to determine the thermal tolerance of a species.;"Climate change; critical thermal limits; CT(max); CT(min); dry mass; guild; hind tibia length; seasonal activities; surface to volume ratio";"BODY-SIZE; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; TERRESTRIAL ARTHROPODS; METHODOLOGICAL CONTEXT; OXYGEN LIMITATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIMITS DEPEND; TEMPERATURE; COLEOPTERA; HEAT";Plant & Animal Science;Entomology;"[Le Lann, Cecile; Serain, Nelly; Van Alphen, Jacques J.

We used a retractable rainfall shelter, to investigate the impact of extreme droughts on the development of Quercus ilex leaves, flowers and fruit. In 2008, 97% of rainfall was excluded from a forest plot during the autumn, representing 50% of the 1127 mm of rain that fell during the year. In 2009, 87% of rainfall was excluded during the spring, representing 58% of the 749 mm that fell during the year. The rainfall shelter did not impact neither incident radiation nor air temperature. Autumn rainfall exclusion did not significantly affect leaf, flowers or fruit development. Spring rainfall exclusion resulted in larger and more sustained depression of leaf water potential during the key phases of foliar and floral development. Consequently, only half of the sampled trees (6) reached the shoot lengthening stage which leads to functionally mature leaves (phenophase 4), with one abandoning leaf development at budburst (phenophase 3) and the other two at the bud swelling stage (phenophase 2). All trees of the control plot passed phenophase 4, with most reaching complete leaf development. The impact of extreme droughts on flower development differed between the sexes. The spring exclusion had no effect on male flower, but only one of six trees completed female fruit maturation, compared with four in the control plot. The difference between the male and female drought impacts is likely attributable to the occurrence of male floral development before the period of lowest leaf water potential, and to the lower resource allocation requirements of male flowers. The information provided by our experimental approach may constitute a crucial step to evaluate the impact of increasing drought due to climate change on the most dominant Mediterranean tree species and to help drawing a full picture of the ecological consequences of the decline in water resource on forest dynamics under changing conditions.;"climate changes; extreme events; flowering; fruiting; leaf-unfolding; rainfall changes";"THROUGHFALL EXCLUSION EXPERIMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT ASSESSMENT; REGIONAL CLIMATE MODEL; QUERCUS-ILEX FOREST; HOLM OAK FORESTS; ACORN PRODUCTION; PHILLYREA-LATIFOLIA; SUMMER DROUGHT; DYNAMICS; LEAF";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Misson, Laurent; Degueldre, David; Collin, Christian; Rodriguez, Raquel; Ourcival, Jean-Marc; Rambal, Serge] CNRS, UMR5175, CEFE, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Rocheteau, Alain] CEFE, IRD, UMR5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France";Rambal, S (reprint author), CNRS, UMR5175, CEFE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.;France;France;FRA;35;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;17;2;1036;1048;;10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02348.x;1354-1013;1365-2486;;1354-1013 eISSN: 1365-2486;;non;0;;oui;1;2011;Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175;Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175;UMR5175;UMR5175;5 - Exceptionelle

The degree of rigidity of the labour markets is a central parameter, and a systematic sensitivity analysis of the model results confirms this. When labour markets are represented as highly flexible, the model results are in the usual range of the existing literature; that is, less than 2% GDP losses in 2030 for a stabilization target at 550 ppm CO(2) equivalent. However, when labour market rigidities are accounted for, mitigation costs increase dramatically. Accompanying measures are identified, namely labour subsidies, which guarantee against the risk of large stabilization costs in the case of high rigidities of the labour markets. This complements the usual view that mitigation is a long-term matter that depends on technology, innovation, investment and behavioural change. The results support the view that mitigation is also a shorter-term issue and a matter of transition with regard to the labour market.";"climate policy costs; labour market rigidities; second-best world; sensitivity analysis";"ECONOMIC-GROWTH; EQUILIBRIUM UNEMPLOYMENT; INCOME-DISTRIBUTION; DOUBLE DIVIDEND; WAGE CURVE; MODEL; MACROECONOMICS; INNOVATION; EMPLOYMENT; TAXATION";"Environment/Ecology; Social Sciences";"Environmental Studies; Public Administration";"[Guivarch, Celine; Crassous, Renaud; Sassi, Olivier; Hallegatte, Stephane] CIRED, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Hallegatte, Stephane] Ecole Natl Meteorol, Toulouse, France";Guivarch, C (reprint author), CIRED, 45bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.;France;France;FRA;13;CLIMATE POLICY;;;;;11;1;768;788;;10.3763/cpol.2009.0012;1469-3062;;;1469-3062;;non;0;;oui;1;2011;Centre international de recherche sur l'environnement et le développement (CIRED), UMR8568;Centre international de recherche sur l'environnement et le développement (CIRED), UMR8568;UMR8568;UMR8568;4 - Excellente

This new technique is based on a modified version of the test called Multiple Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) using the generalized Mahalanobis distance. The technique was applied in the extratropical regions of the North Atlantic Ocean on eight commercially exploited fish species using three environmental parameters (sea surface temperature, bathymetry and sea surface salinity). The numerical procedure and the model allowed a better characterization of the niche (sensu Hutchinson) and an improved modelling of the spatial distribution of the species. Furthermore, the technique appeared to be robust to incomplete or bimodal training sets. Despite some potential limitations related to the choice of the climatic scenarios (A2 and B2), the type of physical model (ECHAM 4) and the absence of consideration of biotic interactions, modelled changes in species distribution explained some current observed shifts in dominance that occurred in the North Atlantic sector, and particularly in the North Sea. Although projected changes suggest a poleward movement of species, our results indicate that some species may not be able to track their climatic envelope and that climate change may have a prominent influence on fish distribution during this century. The phenomenon is likely to trigger locally major changes in the dominance of species with likely implications for socio-economical systems. In this way, ENMs might provide a new management tool against which changes in the resource might be better anticipated.;"biogeography; climate change; ecological niche; ecological niche modelling; marine fish distribution; projections";"PLANT-SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; COD GADUS-MORHUA; GLOBAL CHANGE; HABITAT DISTRIBUTION; SEA; AUTOCORRELATION; FISHERIES; ABUNDANCE; ECOLOGY";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Lenoir, Sylvain; Beaugrand, Gregory; Lecuyer, Eric] Univ Sci & Technol Lille 1, CNRS, LOG, Stn Marine,UMR 8187, F-62930 Wimereux, France";Lenoir, S (reprint author), Univ Sci & Technol Lille 1, CNRS, LOG, Stn Marine,UMR 8187, Lille 1 BP 80, F-62930 Wimereux, France.;France;France;FRA;32;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;17;1;115;129;;10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02229.x;1354-1013;;;1354-1013;;non;0;;oui;1;2011;Laboratoire d'océanologie et de géosciences (LOG), UMR8187;Laboratoire d'océanologie et de géosciences (LOG), UMR8187;UMR8187;UMR8187;5 - Exceptionelle

Therefore, when considering climate-chemistry interactions in the atmosphere, it is not only important to study the emissions of the climate compounds, but also to consider the chemical processes and the distribution of the compounds in the atmospheric regions by assessing their atmospheric sources and fates and determining their lifetimes. A considerable amount of kinetic studies has been carried out in this field. Consequently, progressive improvements in the database for reactions involving atmospheric pollutants and the quantification of their atmospheric lifetimes are made. This is fundamental to understanding the relationship between the budget and the trends of atmospheric pollutants and thus, their impact on the climate. This issue is an essential step helping to develop effective control strategies and to establish appropriate legislations in order to prevent the emission of pollutants and to protect the atmosphere. In this respect, this paper focus on the impact of the gas phase chemistry on the climate and briefly presents the future changes in the Mediterranean climate. The major kinetic methods used in this field in laboratory studies are then reviewed and emphases on their limitations are indicated.

On the basis of very high resolution seismic data combined with sediment cores and AMS dating, these works allow reconstructing the Holocene infill of such singular estuaries, yet rarely documented in the literature. Rate in sea-level rise, bedrock morphology, sediment supply are the main controlling factors of the general infill pattern. Both infills are composed of two units, the transgressive systems tract (TST) and highstand systems tract (HST). The maximum flooding surface (MFS) is dated around 6500 cal BP when the Holocene sea-level rise slowed down, and corresponds to the main architectural change. The TST is poorly preserved compared with the HST that constitutes the main depositional unit, making this incised valley fill deviating from the classical models. The HST is composed above the axis of the incised valley of a highly wandering estuarine channel belt characterized by deep tidal reworking throughout its building. On the margin of this high-energy estuarine system, the HST is made of wave-dominated barriers, tidal flats and offshore tidal banks.. They constitute dominantly aggradational systems, the aggradation rate of which is in accordance with the rate of sea-level rise from 6500 cal BP onwards. Consequently, the impacts of the rapid climate changesthat characterized mid- to late Holocene times can be preserved in these marginal successions. Various sedimentary and geometrical signatures indicate that periodic enhanced storminess episodes, probably related to the Bond Cold Events (similar to 1500 years periodicity), are responsible for the most drastic environmental changes in these macrotidal tide-dominated settings. The role of long term tidal cycles as well as the impact of human activities are also considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In the sea beet Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima, seed dormancy largely controls the timing of germination, is highly heritable and varies geographically; it is therefore thought to be selected by climate. The aim here was to characterize the variation in seed dormancy among sea beet populations across the French distribution area, as well as the ecological factors in situ that are correlated with and that could therefore select for seed dormancy. The relative importance of genetic inheritance vs. non-genetic variation is also evaluated. The proportions of dormant seeds from 85 natural populations encompassing different climates over the whole French distribution area were measured under controlled conditions. Germination phenology was observed in a common garden experiment. Dormancy variation of seeds collected in situ was compared with that of seeds collected on plants grown in the greenhouse. The proportions of dormant seeds in the greenhouse were highly variable, covering almost the entire range from 0 to 1, and followed a geographical pattern from lower dormancy at high latitudes to high dormancy at low latitudes. The distribution of dormancy was positively correlated with yearly temperatures, especially summer temperatures. Minimum temperatures in winter did not significantly explain the trait variation. The genetic component of the total variation was significant and is probably completed by an important adjustment to the local conditions brought about by maternal adaptive phenotypic plasticity. Dormancy in sea beet could be interpreted as a way to limit summer germination and spread germination over the first autumn and spring or following autumns. This highly heritable trait has the potential to evolve in the relatively near future because of climate change.";"Beta vulgaris ssp; maritima; trait distribution; seed dormancy; germination phenology; life history; ecological factors; seasons; climatic factors; latitudinal gradient; climate change";"VULGARIS SSP MARITIMA; RAPID CLIMATE-CHANGE; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; LIFE-HISTORY; SUGAR-BEET; WILD BEET; NATURAL-SELECTION; DESERT ANNUALS; GERMINATION; ADAPTATION";Plant & Animal Science;Plant Sciences;"[Wagmann, Kristen; Hautekeete, Nina-Coralie; Piquot, Yves; Schmitt, S.

The consequences of this uncertainty on optimal dam dimensioning is assessed for a small mountainous catchment in Greece. Optimal dam design is estimated using a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) based on trends in seasonal temperature and precipitations from 19 IPCC-AR4 climate models driven by the the SRES A2 emission scenario. Optimal reservoir volumes are modified by climate change, leading to up to 34% differences between optimal volumes. Contrary to widely-used target-based approaches, the CBA suggests that reduced rainfall should lead to smaller water reservoirs. The resulting change in the Net Present Value (NPV) of water supply is also substantial, ranging from no change to a large 25% loss, depending on the climate model, even assuming optimal adaptation and perfect foresight. In addition, climate change uncertainty can lead to design errors, with a cost ranging from 0.3 to 2.8% of the NPV, depending on site characteristics. This paper proposes to complement the CBA with a robust decision-making approach that focuses on reducing design-error costs. It also suggests that climate change impacts in the water sector may reveal large, that water reservoirs do not always provide a cost-efficient adaptation strategy, and that alternative adaptation strategies based on water conservation and non-conventional water production need to be considered.;;"WATER-RESOURCES; CHANGE IMPACTS; MANAGEMENT";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Nassopoulos, Hypatia; Dumas, Patrice; Hallegatte, Stephane] CIRED, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Nassopoulos, Hypatia] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Dumas, Patrice] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Hallegatte, Stephane] Ecole Natl Meterol Meteo France, F-31057 Toulouse, France";Nassopoulos, H (reprint author), CIRED, Jardin Trop 45 Bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.;France;France;FRA;1;CLIMATIC CHANGE;;;;;114;3-4;497;508;;10.1007/s10584-012-0423-7;0165-0009;;;0165-0009;;non;0;;oui;1;2012;"Centre international de recherche sur l'environnement et le développement (CIRED), UMR8568; Pôle de Recherche en Economie et Gestion de l'Ecole polytechnique (PREG), UMR7176";"Centre international de recherche sur l'environnement et le développement (CIRED), UMR8568; EXCESS, UMR9194";"UMR7176; UMR8568";"UMR8568; UMR9194";4 - Excellente

This factor constitutes one of the reasons why uncertainties about climate sensitivity have remained almost unchanged for more than 30 years, and it is also limiting our current capacity to propose reliable climate projections for the coming century. This paper offers a short review of the studies that have dealt with this issue. A number of approaches aim at a process-oriented diagnostic of current models. These studies are in constant progress since the launch of remote-sensing instruments, such as those from the A-train satellite constellation. Past climate fluctuations may also offer some limited possibilities to discriminate the effects of greenhouse gases and aerosols. There is therefore a real hope that climate projections may eventually become more accurate, which would be extremely useful in monitoring global warming during the next decades.;"Greenhouse gases; Aerosols; Climate sensitivity; Climate feebacks";"GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; SENSITIVITY; ATMOSPHERE; FEEDBACK; SIMULATIONS; DEPENDENCE; OCEAN; CYCLE";Geosciences;Geochemistry & Geophysics;Univ Paris 06, Meteorol Dynam Lab, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Paris, France;Le Treut, H (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, Meteorol Dynam Lab, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Paris, France.;France;France;FRA;3;SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS;;;;;33;3-4;723;731;;10.1007/s10712-012-9190-2;0169-3298;;;0169-3298;;non;0;;oui;1;2012;"Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire de météorologie dynamique (LMD), UMR8539";"Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire de météorologie dynamique (LMD), UMR8539";"FR636; UMR8539";"FR636; UMR8539";4 - Excellente

This article focuses on the case of India. It explores the role of current suboptimalities of the Indian power sector (structural under-investment in the sector leading to capacity shortage, power cuts and low efficiency) on future energy-GDP decoupling. To do so, it uses a hybrid general equilibrium framework, in which these suboptimalities are explicitly introduced. The results highlight that whether the constraints on investments in the power sector persist or not leads to contrasted trends in energy-GDP decoupling and GHG emissions. Over the short-term, capital scarcity in the power sector constrains the development of energy-intensive activities and therefore leads to higher energy-GDP decoupling. But on the longer-term, constrains on the power sector capacity limits substitution from fossil fuels to electricity, which entails both a low energy-GDP decoupling and a constraint on GDP growth when oil prices are high. The alleviation of suboptimalities appears thus as an insurance policy towards future oil price increase.;;"CLIMATE POLICIES; MODELING ENERGY; 2ND-BEST WORLD; EFFICIENCY; GROWTH; INDUSTRIES; COSTS";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Guivarch, Celine] CIRED, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Guivarch, Celine; Mathy, Sandrine] Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, Nogent Sur Marne, France";Guivarch, C (reprint author), CIRED, 45Bis,Av Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.;France;France;FRA;1;CLIMATIC CHANGE;;;;;113;2;339;356;;10.1007/s10584-011-0354-8;0165-0009;;;0165-0009;;non;0;;oui;1;2012;Centre international de recherche sur l'environnement et le développement (CIRED), UMR8568;Centre international de recherche sur l'environnement et le développement (CIRED), UMR8568;UMR8568;UMR8568;4 - Excellente

To investigate this hypothesis, we have considered 2 independent long time series of yield data: one corresponding to the registration trials conducted in France from 1976 to 2010, and the other corresponding to trials from the INRA bread wheat breeding program along the 1970-2010 period. These raw data related to potential bread wheat yield in France, exhibited the same trend to stagnation as observed on national yield in the farms. However, after correction of the year effects, the corrected yields appeared to have increased regularly from the 1970s up to now, with quite a high rate in intensive conditions (from 0.065 t ha(-1) yr(-1) to 0.137 t ha(-1) yr(-1)). This linear trend for genetic progress was even higher without fungicide (from 0.097 t ha(-1) yr(-1) to 0.158 t ha(-1) yr(-1)), which could indicate that breeding efforts for productivity and for resistance to diseases tended to have additive results. The corrected yields also enabled us to point out a marked degradation of the agro-climatic potential of the different years. As our registration and breeding trials were as free as possible from agronomic limiting factors, it appeared that climatic factors constituted the main explanation to this degradation. Thus, our study demonstrated that since the end of the 1980s, genetic progress has been partly or totally counterbalanced by the adverse effects of climate change. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

So far, the cause of these events, which involve changes in the thermohaline circulation, remains an open issue. It has been proposed that small changes in the freshwater flux in the North Atlantic, possibly coming from cyclic variations in solar activity, could act as a pacemaker and synchronize the events. Here we use the general circulation model IPSL_CM4 to investigate the impact of changes in the total solar irradiance (TSI) on the freshwater flux coming from ablation of the Northern hemisphere ice sheets. We test four different TSI values between 1360 and 1375 W/m(2), and in this range establish a linear relationship between TSI and ablation rates over different sectors of the ice sheets. Our results show that a change in TSI smaller than 1%, that would be undetectable in paleo-records, can trigger changes in the freshwater flux in the North Atlantic at an amplitude similar to the one required to synchronize abrupt events in the climate model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER. Given the uncertainties on the past solar activity, we conclude that the hypothesis of a solar origin of the periodicity of D/O events cannot be ruled out and that the relationship between ice ablation and TSI variations is worth being further investigated.

Using dynamical downscaling, a high spatial resolution dataset of wave conditions in the Bay of Biscay is built for three future greenhouse gases emission scenarios. Projected wave heights, periods and directions are analysed at regional scale and more thoroughly at two buoys positions, offshore and along the coast. A general decrease of wave heights is identified (up to -20 cm during summer within the Bay off Biscay), as well as a clockwise shift of summer waves and winter swell coming from direction. The relation between those changes and wind changes is investigated and highlights a complex association of processes at several spatial scales. For instance, the intensification and the northeastward shift of strong wind core in the North Atlantic Ocean explain the clockwise shift of winter swell directions. During summer, the decrease of the westerly winds in the Bay of Biscay explains the clockwise shift and the wave height decrease of wind sea and intermediate waves. Finally, the analysis reveals that the offshore changes in the wave height and the wave period as well as the clockwise shift in the wave direction continue toward the coast. This wave height decrease result is consistent with other regional projections and would impact the coastal dynamics by reducing the longshore sediment flux.;"Climate change; Wave climate; Dynamical downscaling; Bay of Biscay";"MODEL; VARIABILITY; ATLANTIC; SCENARIO; HEIGHTS; SHELF; WIND; SEAS";"Geosciences; Plant & Animal Science";Oceanography;"[Charles, Elodie; Idier, Deborah; Le Cozannet, Goneri] Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, F-45060 Orleans 2, France; [Delecluse, Pascale] Meteo France, CNRM, F-94165 St Mande, France; [Deque, Michel] Meteo France, CNRM, GAME, F-31057 Toulouse, France";Charles, E (reprint author), Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, 3 Ave Guillemin, F-45060 Orleans 2, France.;France;France;FRA;17;OCEAN DYNAMICS;;;;;62;6;831;848;;10.1007/s10236-012-0534-8;1616-7341;1616-7228;;1616-7341 eISSN: 1616-7228;;non;0;;oui;1;2012;Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), URA1357;Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), UMR3589;URA1357;UMR3589;3 - Correcte

Here, we aimed at predicting the future breeding distributions of European birds under climate, land-use, and dispersal scenarios. We predicted current and future distributions of 409 species within an ensemble forecast framework using seven species distribution models (SDMs), five climate scenarios and three emission and land-use scenarios. We then compared results from SDMs using climate-only variables, habitat-only variables or both climate and habitat variables. In order to account for a species dispersal abilities, we used natal dispersal estimates and developed a probabilistic method that produced a dispersal scenario intermediate between the null and full dispersal scenarios generally considered in such studies. We then compared results from all scenarios in terms of future predicted range changes, range shifts, and variations in species richness. Modeling accuracy was better with climate-only variables than with habitat-only variables, and better with both climate and habitat variables. Habitat models predicted smaller range shifts and smaller variations in range size and species richness than climate models. Using both climate and habitat variables, it was predicted that the range of 71% of the species would decrease by 2050, with a 335km median shift. Predicted variations in species richness showed large decreases in the southern regions of Europe, as well as increases, mainly in Scandinavia and northern Russia. The partial dispersal scenario was significantly different from the full dispersal scenario for 25% of the species, resulting in the local reduction of the future predicted species richness of up to 10%. We concluded that the breeding range of most European birds will decrease in spite of dispersal abilities close to a full dispersal hypothesis, and that given the contrasted predictions obtained when modeling climate change only and land-use change only, both scenarios must be taken into consideration.;"climate change; European birds; land-use scenario; natal dispersal; shifts; species distribution models; species richness";"SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; GLOBAL CHANGE; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; MIGRATION RATES; POLEWARD SHIFTS; EXTINCTION RISK; RANGE SHIFTS; MODELS; DIVERSITY";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Barbet-Massin, Morgane; Jiguet, Frederic] Ctr Rech Biol Populat Oiseaux, Museum Natl Hist Nat, MNHN CNRS UPMC UMR 7204, F-75005 Paris, France; [Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS, UMR 5553, F-38041 Grenoble, France";Barbet-Massin, M (reprint author), Ctr Rech Biol Populat Oiseaux, Museum Natl Hist Nat, MNHN CNRS UPMC UMR 7204, CP 51,55 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.;France;France;FRA;56;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;18;3;881;890;;10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02552.x;1354-1013;;;1354-1013;;non;0;;oui;1;2012;"Centre des Sciences de la Conservation (CESCO), UMR7204; Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553";"Centre des Sciences de la Conservation (CESCO), UMR7204; Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553";"UMR5553; UMR7204";"UMR5553; UMR7204";5 - Exceptionelle

This macrotidal estuary is characterized by a low biodiversity in both oligo- and mesohaline zones. Its zooplankton community is constituted by only five major species, three calanoid copepods (including one invasive species) and two mysids. Retrospective analyses have already documented a warming associated to a phenomenon of marinisation. Here, we investigate the influence of both marinisation and warming on the spatial distribution and the abundance of copepods (i.e. Eurytemora affinis, Acartia bifilosa and neritic species) in the Gironde estuary. We modelled the environmental envelope of the copepods as a function of salinity and temperature to demonstrate that the alteration of their longitudinal distribution in the estuary between 1975 and 2003 was the result of both changing temperature and salinity. Although the upstream movement of neritic species was mostly related to salinity, we show that the augmentation of both temperature and salinity was at the origin of the upstream progression of both A. bifilosa and E. affinis. These results suggest that the distribution of copepods can be affected by both anthropogenic forcing and climatic change, which modulate the physic-chemistry of the Gironde estuary.

Thirteen models have been selected in order to discuss (1) potential improvements in the simulation of present-day climate and (2) the potential reduction in the uncertainties of the model response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. While several features of present-day precipitation-including annual cycle, spatial distribution and co variability with tropical sea surface temperature (SST)-have been improved, strong uncertainties remain in the climate projections. A closer comparison between CMIP5 and CMIP3 highlights a weaker consensus on increased precipitation during the wet season, but a stronger consensus on a drying and lengthening of the dry season. The latter response is related to a northward shift of the boreal summer intertropical convergence zone in CMIP5, in line with a more asymmetric warming between the northern and southern hemispheres. The large uncertainties that persist in the rainfall response arise from contrasted anomalies in both moisture convergence and evapotranspiration. They might be related to the diverse response of tropical SST and ENSO (El Nio Southern Oscillation) variability, as well as to spurious behaviours among the models that show the most extreme response. Model improvements of present-day climate do not necessarily translate into more reliable projections and further efforts are needed for constraining the pattern of the SST response and the soil moisture feedback in global climate scenarios.;"CMIP; Amazonian precipitation; Model evaluation; Climate change; Uncertainties";"SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; RAIN-FOREST; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; NINO EVENTS; DROUGHT; CYCLE; DIEBACK; PATTERNS; IMPACT; BASIN";Geosciences;Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences;"[Joetzjer, E.; Douville, H.; Delire, C.] CNRM GAME, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Ciais, P.] Lab Climate Sci & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France";Joetzjer, E (reprint author), CNRM GAME, 42 Ave G Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse, France.;France;France;FRA;15;CLIMATE DYNAMICS;;;;;41;11-12;2921;2936;;10.1007/s00382-012-1644-1;0930-7575;1432-0894;;0930-7575 eISSN: 1432-0894;;non;0;;oui;1;2013;"Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), UMR3589; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), UMR3589; Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE), UMR8212";"UMR3589; UMR8212";"UMR3589; UMR8212";4 - Excellente

This is done by taking into account the fact that the climate response to increased carbon dioxide (CO2) is not necessarily only mediated by surface temperature changes, but can also result from fast land warming and tropospheric adjustments to the CO2 radiative forcing. By considering tropospheric adjustments to CO2 as part of the forcing rather than as feedbacks, and by using the radiative kernels approach, we decompose climate sensitivity estimates in terms of feedbacks and adjustments associated with water vapor, temperature lapse rate, surface albedo and clouds. Cloud adjustment to CO2 is, with one exception, generally positive, and is associated with a reduced strength of the cloud feedback; the multi-model mean cloud feedback is about 33 % weaker. Non-cloud adjustments associated with temperature, water vapor and albedo seem, however, to be better understood as responses to land surface warming. Separating out the tropospheric adjustments does not significantly affect the spread in climate sensitivity estimates, which primarily results from differing climate feedbacks. About 70 % of the spread stems from the cloud feedback, which remains the major source of inter-model spread in climate sensitivity, with a large contribution from the tropics. Differences in tropical cloud feedbacks between low-sensitivity and high-sensitivity models occur over a large range of dynamical regimes, but primarily arise from the regimes associated with a predominance of shallow cumulus and stratocumulus clouds. The combined water vapor plus lapse rate feedback also contributes to the spread of climate sensitivity estimates, with inter-model differences arising primarily from the relative humidity responses throughout the troposphere. Finally, this study points to a substantial role of nonlinearities in the calculation of adjustments and feedbacks for the interpretation of inter-model spread in climate sensitivity estimates. We show that in climate model simulations with large forcing (e.g., 4 x CO2), nonlinearities cannot be assumed minor nor neglected. Having said that, most results presented here are consistent with a number of previous feedback studies, despite the very different nature of the methodologies and all the uncertainties associated with them.";"Climate sensitivity; Feedback; Radiative forcing; Fast adjustment; Radiative kernel; CMIP5 climate model simulations; Climate change; Inter-model spread";"RADIATIVE KERNEL TECHNIQUE; TROPOSPHERIC ADJUSTMENT; FEEDBACK PROCESSES; CLOUD FEEDBACK; RANGE; STATE";Geosciences;Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences;"[Vial, Jessica; Dufresne, Jean-Louis; Bony, Sandrine] CNRS, Meteorol Dynam Lab, F-75752 Paris 05, France; [Vial, Jessica; Dufresne, Jean-Louis; Bony, Sandrine] Univ Paris 06, F-75752 Paris 05, France";Vial, J (reprint author), CNRS, Meteorol Dynam Lab, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75752 Paris 05, France.;France;France;FRA;45;CLIMATE DYNAMICS;;;;;41;11-12;3339;3362;;10.1007/s00382-013-1725-9;0930-7575;1432-0894;;0930-7575 eISSN: 1432-0894;;non;0;;oui;1;2013;Laboratoire de météorologie dynamique (LMD), UMR8539;Laboratoire de météorologie dynamique (LMD), UMR8539;UMR8539;UMR8539;4 - Excellente

Assessing distribution shifts in recent decades;2013;"Comte, L; Grenouillet, G";"Comte, Lise; Grenouillet, Gael";ECOGRAPHY Volume: 36 Issue: 11 Pages: 1236-1246 Published: 2013;English;Article;Understanding the ability of species to shift their distribution ranges in response to climate change is crucial for conservation biologists and resources managers. Although freshwater ecosystems include some of the most imperilled fauna worldwide, such range shifts have been poorly documented in streams and rivers and have never been compared to the current velocity of climate change. Based on national monitoring data, we examined the distributional changes of 32 stream fish species in France and quantified potential time lags in species responses, providing a unique opportunity to analyze range shifts over recent decades of warming in freshwater environments. A multi-facetted approach, based on several range measures along spatial gradients, allowed us to quantify range shifts of numerous species across the whole hydrographic network between an initial period (1980-1992) and a contemporary one (2003-2009), and to contrast them to the rates of isotherm shift in elevation and stream distance. Our results highlight systematic species shifts towards higher elevation and upstream, with mean shifts in range centre of 13.7 m decade(-1) and 0.6 km decade(-1), respectively. Fish species displayed dispersal-driven expansions along the altitudinal gradient at their upper range limit (61.5 m decade(-1)), while substantial range contractions at the lower limit (6.3 km decade(-1)) were documented for most species along the upstream-downstream gradient. Despite being consistent with the geographic variation in climate change velocities, these patterns reveal that the majority of stream fish have not shifted at a pace sufficient to track changing climate, in particular at their range centre where range shifts lag far behind expectation. Our study provides evidence that stream fish are currently responding to recent climate warming at a greater rate than many terrestrial organisms, although not as much as needed to cope with future climate modifications.;;"FRESH-WATER BIODIVERSITY; GEOGRAPHIC RANGE SIZE; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; POLEWARD SHIFTS; CHANGE IMPACTS; BROWN TROUT; CONSERVATION; 20TH-CENTURY; RESPONSES; BIRDS";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology";"[Comte, Lise; Grenouillet, Gael] CNRS, UPS, ENFA, EDB UMR5174,Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol, FR-31062 Toulouse, France; [Comte, Lise; Grenouillet, Gael] Univ Toulouse, UPS, EDB UMR5174, FR-31062 Toulouse, France";Comte, L (reprint author), CNRS, UPS, ENFA, EDB UMR5174,Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol, 118 Route Narbonne, FR-31062 Toulouse, France.;France;France;FRA;16;ECOGRAPHY;;;;;36;11;1236;1246;;10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00282.x;0906-7590;1600-0587;;0906-7590 eISSN: 1600-0587;;non;0;;oui;1;2013;Evolution et diversité biologique (EDB), UMR5174;Evolution et diversité biologique (EDB), UMR5174;UMR5174;UMR5174;5 - Exceptionelle

But climate projections for the end of the 21st century are developed with general circulation models of climate, which do not present a sufficient horizontal resolution to accurately evaluate the impacts of warming on these regions. Several techniques are then used to perform a spatial downscaling (on the order of 10 km). There are two categories of downscaling methods : dynamical methods that require significant computational resources for the achievement of regional climate simulations at high resolution, and statistical methods that require few resources but an observation dataset over a long period and of good quality. In this study, climate simulations of the global atmospheric model ARPEGE projections over France are downscaled according to a dynamical method, performed with the ALADIN-Climate regional model, and a statistical method performed with the software DSClim developed at CERFACS. The two downscaling methods are presented and the results on the climate of the French mountains are evaluated for the current climate. Both methods give similar results for average snowfall. However extreme events of total precipitation (droughts, intense precipitation events) are largely underestimated by the statistical method. Then, the results of both methods are compared for two future climate projections, according to the greenhouse gas emissions scenario A1B of IPCC. The two methods agree on fewer frost days, a significant decrease in the amounts of solid precipitation and an average increase in the percentage of dry days of more than 10%. The results obtained on Corsica are more heterogeneous but they are questionable because the reduced spatial domain is probably not very relevant regarding statistical sampling.;"statistical and dynamical downscaling; climate projections; mountains; precipitations";"GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; PRECIPITATION";"Engineering; Environment/Ecology";Water Resources;"[Piazza, Marie; Page, Christian; Sanchez-Gomez, Emilia; Terray, Laurent] CERFACS, CNRS, SUC, URA 1875, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Deque, Michel] Meteo France, CNRS, CNRM GAME, UMR3589, Toulouse, France";Piazza, M (reprint author), CERFACS, CNRS, SUC, URA 1875, F-31057 Toulouse, France.;France;France;FRA;0;HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU;;;;;;5;22;29;;10.1051/lhb/2013039;0018-6368;1958-5551;;0018-6368 eISSN: 1958-5551;;non;0;;oui;1;2013;"Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), UMR3589; Sciences de l'Univers au CERFACS (SUC), URA1875";"Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), UMR3589; Sciences de l'Univers au CERFACS (SUC), URA1875";"UMR3589; URA1875";"UMR3589; URA1875";1 - Médiocre

Dissolution and precipitation reactions for portlandite (CH) and calcite (C (C) over bar) are described by mass action laws and threshold of ion activity products in order to account for complete dissolved minerals. A generalization of the mass action law is derived from thermodynamics and applied to calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) to take into account the continuous variation (decrease) of the C/S ratio during the dissolution reaction of C-S-H. We assume thermodynamical equilibrium for chemical processes. The porosity changes induced by the precipitation and dissolution reactions are also taken into account. Ion transport is described by using the Nernst-Planck equation as well as advection. Couplings between transport equations and chemical reactions are treated thanks to several mass balance equations written for each atom. We simulate by a finite volume method some experiments reported in the literature and compare our numerical results to these experimental observations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A significant warming (1 degrees-3 degrees C), appearing by the mid-1960s over Sahara and Sahel, is associated with higher/lesser frequency of warm/cold temperatures, as with longer duration and higher occurrences of heat waves. Heat waves episodes of at least 4 day duration have been examined after removing the long-term evolution. These episodes are associated with specific anomalies: (i) in spring, positive low-level temperature anomalies over the Sahel and Sahara; low and midlevel cyclonic rotation over Morocco associated with a Rossby wave pattern, lessening the Harmattan; more/less atmospheric moisture westward/eastward to 0 degrees; upward/downward anomalies above the western/eastern regions associated with the Rossby wave pattern; (ii) in summer, a similar but weaker positive low-level temperature anomaly (up to 3 degrees C); less moisture westward to 10 degrees W, a cyclonic anomaly in central Sahel favoring the monsoon eastward to 0 degrees and a midlevel anticyclonic anomaly over the Western Sahara, increasing southward the flux divergence associated with the African Easterly Jet. In March-May, two to three heat waves propagate eastward. They are preceded by an abnormal warm cell over Libya and southwesterlies over the West Sahara. A large trough stands over North Atlantic while midtropospheric subsidence and anticyclonic rotation reinforce over the continent, then migrates toward the Arabian peninsula in breaking up.

For the whole dataset, the stoichiometty of the reaction was highly correlated with the extent of Mg release, and congruent reactions were observed for the whole pH range only at T = 90 degrees C. Far from equilibrium, dissolution rates in dilute HCl solutions based on Si release and normalized to BET surface area can be described by: r = k(0) exp(-E-a/RT)a(H+)(n) with k(0) = 10(-2.27 +/- 0.56) mol.m(-2).s(-1); E-a = 42.0 +/- 1.5 kJ.mol(-1); R is the gas constant, n = 0.53 +/- 0.08. Moreover, in the pH range 3.2-6.2, the concentration of protons at the lizardite surface is proportional to a(H+)(0.47), which suggests that the dissolution rate has a first-order dependence on the surface concentration of protons. When the reaction was initiated in solutions equilibrated with elevated pCO(2), a slight increase of the dissolution rate (up to a 5-fold factor at pH = 5.0) was observed with respect to CO2-free solutions at the same pH. This may be attributed to the rate enhancing effect of HCO3- ligands. For any single pH-T condition investigated in the present study, lizardite dissolution rates are orders of magnitude lower than those of other anhydrous basic silicates, such as olivine or pyroxenes. The sluggishness of the dissolution reaction probably explains the slow carbonation rates that have been measured in previous studies. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Since thermotolerance data remain scarce, heat-induced necrosis was monitored in aquarium by morphometric analysis. Gorgonian tips were sampled at two sites: Medes (Spain) and Riou (France) Islands, and at two depths: 15 m and-35 m. Although coming from contrasting thermal regimes, seawater above 28 degrees C led to rapid and complete tissue necrosis for all four populations. However, at 27 degrees C, the time length leading to 50% tissue necrosis allowed us to classify samples within three classes of thermal sensitivity. Irrespectively of the depth, Medes specimens were either very sensitive or resistant, while Riou fragments presented a medium sensitivity. Microsatellite analysis revealed that host and symbiont were genetically differentiated between sites, but not between depths. Finally, these genetic differentiations were not directly correlated to a specific thermal sensitivity whose molecular bases remain to be discovered. (C) 2013 Academie des sciences.

The intrinsic complexity of local processes is added to the difficulty of estimating spatially-distributed inputs such as rainfall and temperature, which often exhibit a high spatial heterogeneity that cannot be fully captured by the measurement network. Hence, an interpolation step is often required prior to the hydrological modelling step. In most cases, the reconstruction of meteorological forcings and the calibration of the hydrological model are done sequentially. The outputs of the hydrological model (discharge estimates) may give some insight on the quality of the reconstructed forcings used to feed it, but in this two-step approach it is not possible to easily feed the interpolation scheme back with the discrepancies between observed and simulated discharges. Yet, despite having undergone the rainfall runoff (or snow runoff) transformation, discharge at the outlet of a (sub)catchment is still an interesting integrator (spatial low-pass filter) of the forcing fields and is an ancillary areal information complementing the direct, point-scale data collected at raingauges. In this perspective, choosing the best interpolation scheme partly becomes an inverse hydrological problem. In this study, we present a one-step calibration strategy where the parameters of both the interpolation model (i.e. reconstruction procedure of meteorological forcings) and of the hydrological model (i.e. snow cover evolution, soil moisture accounting, and flow routing schemes) are jointly inferred in a multi-site and multi-variable approach, using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Interpolated fields are daily rainfall and temperature, whereas hydrological prognostic variables consist of discharge and snow water equivalent (SWE) time series at several locations in the 3600 km(2) Upper Durance River catchment (French Alps).;"rainfall re-analysis; temperature reanalysis; geotatistics; rainfall-runoff modelling; multiobjective calibration; assimilation";;"Engineering; Environment/Ecology";Water Resources;[Le Moine, Nicolas] Univ Paris 06, UMR Sisyphe 7619, Paris, France;Le Moine, N (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, UMR Sisyphe 7619, Paris, France.;France;France;FRA;0;COLD AND MOUNTAIN REGION HYDROLOGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE: TOWARDS IMPROVED PROJECTIONS;IAHS Publication;Symposium of H02m IAHS-IAPSO-IASPEI Assembly;JUL 22-26, 2013;Gothenburg, SWEDEN;360;;13;18;;;0144-7815;;978-1-907161-38-4;0144-7815;Symposium of H02m IAHS-IAPSO-IASPEI Assembly Date: JUL 22-26, 2013 Location: Gothenburg, SWEDEN;non;0;;oui;1;2013;Milieux Environnementaux, Transferts et Interactions dans les hydrosystèmes et les Sols (METIS), UMR7619;Milieux Environnementaux, Transferts et Interactions dans les hydrosystèmes et les Sols (METIS), UMR7619;UMR7619;UMR7619;0 - Sans notoriété

This alternative offers a unique opportunity for a net removal of atmospheric CO2 while fulfilling energy needs. Empirical studies using bottom-up energy models show that BECCS has an important role to play in the future energy mix. Most of these studies focus on global BECCS potential, whereas it is of interest to understand where this mitigation option will be deployed. This key issue will strongly depend on regions' biomass resources and possession of storage sites. The aim of this study is to assess the global and regional potential of BECCS up to 2050 in power generation. This analysis is conducted using the multiregional TIAM-FR optimization model. The climate policy scenarios investigated lead to a considerable expansion of renewable energy and CCS and BECCS technologies in the power sector. CCS from fossil fuel is mainly deployed in fast developing countries (India and China) and BECCS is highly distributed in developing countries, even though biomass resources are widely available in all regions.

Wave results are validated directly against data originating from voluntary observing ships and satellite altimetry in the North-East Atlantic Ocean. The normalized error for yearly-mean significant wave height (H-s) is shown to be of the order of 5% for the second part of the 20th century. An indirect validation is also performed through 10 m wind speed and suggests that the accuracy of yearly-mean H, only slightly decreases for the beginning of the 20th century. The comparison between H, and the index of the North Atlantic Oscillation revealed that this phenomenon partly controls H, inter-annual variability, with a positive (negative) correlation in the northeastern (southwestern) part of the study area. The analysis of model results shows an increase in H-s over the whole North Atlantic Ocean superimposed to the inter-annual variability, reaching 0.01 m.yr(-1) (20 to 40% over the 20th century) north of 50 degrees N. This increase is explained by a rise in wind speed exceeding 20% north of 50 degrees N. The roughening in the wave climate demonstrated in this study is expected to have strong implications for the development of coastal zones and could explain the increase in erosion along the North Atlantic shorelines.

First, the regional evolution of temperature and bioclimatic indices were studied over the past 60 years in the wine-producing area of the Loire Valley and showed a general warming at all locations in the regional weather station network (Meteo-France). Secondly, temperature data from weather stations located within the vineyards between Angers and Saumur were studied for the year 2010 and underlined spatial variability of temperature between the different plots according to the different topoclimates. Finally, particular attention was paid to the Coteaux du Layon vineyards (sweet wine producing appellation) where 21 temperature data loggers were set up in the vine rows to study climate at local scale. The study showed, in particular, that the spatial variability of temperature and bioclimatic indices in these vineyards was greater than those observed at larger scales.

Mechanisms must prevent two sorts of free-riding problems-free riding in effort provision and free riding in participation. As markets might fail to solve simultaneously those two problems, we construct instead a simple menu of options that trades off the provision of incentives for participating countries and the provision of incentives to participate.

We assess France climate evolution during the 20th and 21st century as simulated by an exhaustive range of global climate simulations. We first show that the large observed warming of the last 30 years can be simulated only if anthropogenic forcings are taken into account. We also suggest that human influence could have made a substantial contribution to the observed 20th century multi-decadal temperature fluctuations. We then show that France averaged annual mean temperature at the end of the 21st century is projected to be on the order of 4.5 K warmer than in the early 20th century under the radiative concentration pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario. Summer changes are greater than their winter counterpart (6 K versus 3.7 K). Near-future (2020-2049) changes are on the order of 2.1 K (with 2.6 K in summer and 1.8 K in winter). Model projections also suggest a substantial summer precipitation decrease (-0.6 mm/day), in particular over southern France, and a moderate winter increase, (0.3 mm/day), mostly over the northernmost part of France. Uncertainties about the amplitude of these precipitation changes remain large. We then quantify the various sources of uncertainty and study how their ranking varies with time. We also propose a physically-based metric approach to reduce model uncertainty and illustrate it with the case of summer temperature changes. Finally, timing and amplitude of France climate change in case of a global average 2-K warming are investigated. Aggressive mitigation pathways (such as RCP2.6) are absolutely required to avoid crossing or barely exceeding the 2-K global threshold. However, France climate change requiring adaptation measures is still to be expected even if we achieve to remain below the 2-K global target. (C) 2013 Academie des sciences.

Using 12 atmosphere-ocean global climate models of the third Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) we propose a multi-model (MM) analysis contrasting the 19601999 period (20c3m integration) and the 20312070 period (A1B emission scenario). The analyses are based on MM response but also on the one model-one vote' concept to give the same weight to each model. The results show robust signals in the rainfall response, i.e., increasing (decreasing) amounts in central (western) Sahel associated with specific changes in atmospheric dynamics. The rainfall excesses expected in central Sahel are mainly linked to an enhancement of the northern Hadley-type cell and probably to its northward shift. At low-levels increasing temperature and evaporation strengthen the monsoon flux. Rainfall deficits predicted westward are due to a reinforcement of the African Easterly Jet and to anomalies in the zonal circulation between the Indian and the Atlantic Oceans, favouring air subsidence and moisture export outside the region. The weakening of the meridional circulation is also able to prevent rainfall amounts in the western part of the Sahel. More generally, these analyses show that in future works the Sahel region must not be considered as one consistent region but as two separate areas, both sides of the Greenwich meridian. The authors propose to consider this feature in the next Fifth Assessment cycle (AR5) in order to better understand the impacts of the climate change on West Africa.

The energyeconomyenvironment (E3) IMACLIM-R model is used to provide a detailed representation of passenger and freight transportation. Unlike many of the E3 models used to simulate mitigation options, IMACLIM-R represents both the technological and behavioural determinants of mobility. By comparing business-as-usual, carbon price only, and carbon price combined with transport policy scenarios, it is demonstrated that the measures that foster a modal shift towards low-carbon modes and a decoupling of mobility needs from economic activity significantly modify the sectoral distribution of mitigation efforts and reduce the level of carbon tax necessary to reach a given climate target relative to a carbon price only' policy. Policy relevance Curbing carbon emissions from transport activities is necessary in order to reach mitigation targets, but it poses a challenge for policy makers. The transport sector has two peculiarities: a weak ability to react to standard pricing measures (which encourages richer policy interventions) and a dependence on long-lived infrastructure (which imposes a delay between policy interventions and effective action). To address these problems, a framework is proposed for analysing the role of transport-specific measures adopted complementarily to carbon pricing in the context of international climate policies. Consideration is given to alternative approaches such as infrastructure measures designed to control mobility through less mobility-intensive denser agglomerations, investment reorientation towards public mode, and logistics reorganization towards less mobility-dependent production processes. Such measures can significantly reduce transport emissions in the long term and hence would moderate an increase in the carbon price and reduce its more important detrimental impacts on the economy.;"infrastructure; mitigation policy; spatial organization; transport";"PASSENGER TRANSPORT; TRAVEL-TIME; ENERGY; CONSUMPTION; FORM; DEMAND; INCOME";"Environment/Ecology; Social Sciences";"Environmental Studies; Public Administration";"[Waisman, Henri-David; Guivarch, Celine; Lecocq, Franck] CIRED, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France";Waisman, HD (reprint author), CIRED, 45 Bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.;France;France;FRA;7;CLIMATE POLICY;;;;;13;;106;129;;10.1080/14693062.2012.735916;1469-3062;1752-7457;;1469-3062 eISSN: 1752-7457;;non;0;;oui;1;2013;Centre international de recherche sur l'environnement et le développement (CIRED), UMR8568;Centre international de recherche sur l'environnement et le développement (CIRED), UMR8568;UMR8568;UMR8568;4 - Excellente

Here, we review the principal causes for distributional shifts in tick populations and their consequences in terms of the ecological attributes of the species in question (i.e. phenotypic and genetic responses), pathogen transmission and disease epidemiology.

In the Var sediment-routing system, northwestern Mediterranean Sea, the absence of a continental shelf results in a direct connection between the Var River mouth and the deep basin during both highstand and lowstand conditions. This makes the Var sediment-routing system an ideal target to test whether rivers can transmit climate-driven high-frequency changes in sediment flux to the ocean. On the basis of an unprecedented (centennial-to-millennial-scale) resolution in turbidite sequences, we reconstructed the activity of turbidity current overflows along the deep-sea Var Sedimentary Ridge over the past 75 kyr. The overflow activity is highest (one event every 10-30 yr) during maximum glacial conditions (30 kyr-16 kyr ago [ka]) and rapidly decreases (down to one event every 100-500 yr) during the last glacial-interglacial transition (Termination 1). During marine isotope stage (MIS)4 and MIS3 (75-30 ka), peaks in the overflow activity occurred synchronously with cold and arid Dansgaard-Oeschger stadials, while warmer and wetter interstadial conditions correspond to low overflow activity. We conclude that overflow activity on the Var Sedimentary Ridge mainly reflects changes in the magnitude of hyperpycnal currents flowing in the turbiditic channel-levee system in relation with variations in suspended-sediment concentration during Var River floods. We show that this signal is sensitive to changes in pure sediment flux induced by climatic perturbations occurring inland: (1) the decrease in glacier-derived sediment input after glacier retreat and (2) changes in erosion induced by shifts in the vegetation cover in response to Dansgaard-Oeschger climate swings.;;"LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM; VAR TURBIDITE SYSTEM; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; TEMPERATURE-CHANGES; SEDIMENT DELIVERY; ARMORICAN MARGIN; FRENCH RIVIERA; TIME SCALES; RECORD; CURRENTS";Geosciences;Geology;"[Bonneau, Lucile; Emmanuel, Laurent] Univ Paris 04, Univ Paris 06, Lab Biomineralisat & Environm Sedimentaires, Paris, France; [Bonneau, Lucile; Emmanuel, Laurent] Inst Sci Terre Paris, CNRS, Unite Mixte Rech 7193, Paris, France; [Bonneau, Lucile; Jorry, Stephan J.; Toucanne, Samuel; Jacinto, Ricardo Silva] IFREMER, Lab Environm Sedimentaires, F-29280 Plouzane, France";Bonneau, L (reprint author), Univ Paris 04, Univ Paris 06, Lab Biomineralisat & Environm Sedimentaires, Paris, France.;France;France;FRA;2;JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY;;;;;122;6;687;703;;10.1086/677844;0022-1376;1537-5269;;0022-1376 eISSN: 1537-5269;;non;0;;oui;1;2014;Institut des Sciences de la Terre Paris (iSTeP), UMR7193;Institut des Sciences de la Terre Paris (iSTeP), UMR7193;UMR7193;UMR7193;4 - Excellente

Although the consequences of climate change on ecosystem properties and associated services are well documented, the cascading impacts of climate change on ESs through changes in land use are largely overlooked. We present a trait-based framework based on an empirical model to elucidate how climate change affects tradeoffs among ESs. Using alternative scenarios for mountain grasslands, we predicted how direct effects of climate change on ecosystems and indirect effects through farmers' adaptations are likely to affect ES bundles through changes in plant functional properties. ES supply was overall more sensitive to climate than to induced management change, and ES bundles remained stable across scenarios. These responses largely reflected the restricted extent of management change in this constrained system, which was incorporated when scaling up plot level climate and management effects on ecosystem properties to the entire landscape. The trait-based approach revealed how the combination of common driving traits and common responses to changed fertility determined interactions and tradeoffs among ESs.;"plant functional traits; trade-offs; global change; mountain agriculture";"SUB-ALPINE GRASSLANDS; LAND-USE CHANGE; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; TRADE-OFFS; LANDSCAPES; MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY; SCENARIOS; FRAMEWORK; FARMERS";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Lamarque, Penelope; Lavorel, Sandra; Mouchet, Maud; Quetier, Fabien] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Unite Mixte Rech 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France";Lamarque, P (reprint author), Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Unite Mixte Rech 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, BP 53, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France.;France;France;FRA;5;PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA;;;;;111;38;13751;13756;;10.1073/pnas.1216051111;0027-8424;;;0027-8424;;non;0;;oui;1;2014;Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553;Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553;UMR5553;UMR5553;5 - Exceptionelle

The pollen record shows a continuous vegetal cover since 13 kyr BP. Aluminum and pollen deposition characterize the Younger Dryas (YD) cold event at 12.3-11.0 kyr BP, within its expected time frame in Northern Europe. Aluminum fluxes reveal four other significant dust events with significant Asian and Saharan sources, as shown with variations in stable Pb-204, Pb-206, and Pb-207 isotopes. Recurrent Asian incursions are seen at Bozi Dar during the YD and Mid-Holocene dust events (at 7.1, 6.5, and 5.9 kyr BP). These Asian imprints are also observed by Le Roux and colleagues during the YD in the nearest Holocene-long geochemical peat record from Switzerland (Etang de la Gru re). We do not see at Bozi Dar the distinct western European volcanic inputs identified in the Swiss peat by Shotyk and colleagues. However, isotopic ratios characteristics of Mediterranean airflows are evident at both locations during the Mid-and Late Holocene. The occurrence of these various air mass sources in Switzerland and the Czech Republic substantiates Holocene atmospheric circulation models in Central Europe with dominating zonal airflows during the Early Holocene, followed by a governing meridian dispersion during the Mid-and Late Holocene. Lead inputs at 5.1-4.3 and 1.9 kyr BP cannot be explained by increased dust deposition only. The 1.9 kyr event fits local Bohemian ore isotopic imprints of which isotopic signatures are seen as early as 2.2 kyr BP in our core, hence revealing the oldest ever environmental record of mining-related activities in the Czech Republic. Relatively elevated Pb deposition at 5.1 and 4.3 kyr BP are tentatively attributed to contamination that may be from local sources and/or long-range transport.;"Asia; Central Europe; dust; Holocene; lead isotopes; Mediterranean; mining; peat bog; pollen";"ATMOSPHERIC LEAD POLLUTION; YOUNGER DRYAS EVENT; C-14 YR BP; LAST GLACIAL PERIOD; MONT-LOZERE MASSIF; PB ISOTOPE RECORD; NORTHERN SWEDEN; LAKE-SEDIMENTS; PEAT BOG; HOLOCENE CLIMATE";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary";[Veron, Alain] Aix Marseille Univ, F-13545 Aix En Provence 4, France;Veron, A (reprint author), Aix Marseille Univ, CEREGE UM34, UMR CNRS 7730, BP80, F-13545 Aix En Provence 4, France.;France;France;FRA;0;HOLOCENE;;;;;24;8;919;931;;10.1177/0959683614534746;0959-6836;1477-0911;;0959-6836 eISSN: 1477-0911;;non;0;;oui;1;2014;Centre européen de recherche et d'enseignement de géosciences de l'environnement (CEREGE), UMR7330;Centre européen de recherche et d'enseignement de géosciences de l'environnement (CEREGE), UMR7330;UMR7330;UMR7330;3 - Correcte

We test the models' individual performances for simulating water temperatures and assess the variability of the thermal responses under the extreme changing climate scenarios that are projected for 2081-2100. We attempt to identify the most reliable models for studying the impact of climate change on river temperature (T-w). Six models are based on a linear relationship between air temperatures (T-a) and equilibrium temperatures (T-e), six depend on a logistic relationship, and six rely on the closure of heat budgets. For each category, three approaches that account for the river's thermal exchange coefficient are tested. In addition to air temperatures, an index of day length is incorporated to compute equilibrium temperatures. Each model is analysed in terms of its ability to simulate the seasonal patterns of river temperatures and heat peaks. We found that including the day length as a covariate in regression-based approaches improves the performance in comparison with classical approaches that use only T-a. Moreover, the regression-based models that rely on the logistic relationship between T-e and T-a exhibit root mean square errors comparable (0.90 degrees C) with those obtained with a classical five-term heat budget model (0.82 degrees C), despite a small number of required forcing variables. In contrast, the regressive models that are based on a linear relationship T-e=f(T-a) fail to simulate the heat peaks and are not advisable for climate change studies. The regression-based approaches that are based on a logistic relationship and the heat balance approaches generate notably similar responses to the projected climate changes scenarios. This similarity suggests that sophisticated thermal models are not preferable to cruder ones, which are less time-consuming and require fewer input data.

Regarding these technologies, the main issue is the high cost of avoided CO2 related to capture (approximate to 40 (sic)/t). In conventional amine-based CO2 capture process, the four main key parameters driving the cost of avoided CO2 are the regeneration duty, the compression works, the compressor cost and the solvent make-up cost. On the one hand, the use of hollow fibre membrane contactor (HFMC) for CO2 capture is foreseen to be an efficient technology for absorber intensification; but regarding the impact of the absorber cost on the cost of avoided CO2, the use of HFMC for process intensification does not seem relevant. On the other hand, ammonia as solvent for CO2 capture is a cheap solvent with no degradation problem. Moreover, it allows a high pressure regeneration reducing the compression works. The key idea of this work is to find a membrane with high CO2/NH3 selectivity and high permeability in order to use aqueous ammonia as a solvent in a HFMC in order to reduce significantly the ammonia slip in flue gases while maintaining high absorption rate. The work has been divided in three main steps: the screening of available material for the membrane, the laboratory test of the membrane and the modelling of the system for process assessment. For this absorption device a total equivalent work of 240 kWh/ t(CO2) has been calculated for CO2 capture on a coal-fired power plant. (C) 2014 The Authors.

A deep geological CO2 storage is not expected to leak but potential leakage monitoring is required by legislation, as e.g. the EU Directive relative to Geological Storage of CO2. To ensure that the storage will be permanent and safe for the environment and human health, the legislation require that the CCS operators monitor the injection, the storage complex and if needed the environment to detect any CO2 leakage and its hazardous effects on the environment. Various monitoring methods are available for the monitoring of CO2 storage sites and the environment as listed by the IEA-GHG and the monitoring selection tool. Geophysical based methods have a greater area of investigation but may suffer from insufficient sensitivities to detect small leakages. At the opposite, geochemical monitoring methods may have insufficient investigation area but may be able to detect more subtle changes even if monitoring in deep environments is not straightforward. Leakage detection is not yet well constrained and research efforts and tests are required to gain confidence into monitoring strategies. In the framework of the CIPRES project, funded by the French Research Agency, a shallow CO2 release experiment has been performed in October 2013 in a chalk aquifer from the Paris basin. The Catenoy site has been characterised since March 2013 through several wells set on a straight line oriented along the local flow (see Gombert et al., this conference). Such an experiment is designed to gain confidence in leakage detection in subsurface environments by understanding processes and principles governing seepage occurrence. Contrary to other experiments such as ZERT or CO2-FieldLab ones, where gaseous CO2 was injected directly in the water, the injection was done with water saturated with CO2 at atmospheric pressure. 10 m3 of water were pumped from the aquifer, then saturated with 20 kg of food-grade CO2 and injected during 40 hours between 12 and 25 m depth. Daily monitoring of soil gases and water was performed during injection and post-injection phases (2 weeks duration) in the area previously delimited by a tracer test. The aim is to determine if geochemical methods are accurate enough to allow detecting small release in shallow environments. If successful, such an experiment can help to gain confidence in leakage detection. As expected, no change was noticed in the unsaturated zone. The shape of gas concentrations distribution at the surface (CO2. O-2, N-2, He-4, Rn-222) observed during the injection is strictly similar to the repartition of gas species observed since March 2013. The main process observed is respiration and no change linked to the injection was highlighted, only seasonal effects. Slight changes were observed in the saturated zone. The water was collected at 15 m deep excepted for one stratified borehole where water was sampled at 15 and 18 m. The pH of the injected water was lower (mean value: 5.3 0.1) than the initial pH of the aquifer (7.1-7.2) due to CO2 dissolution. Only two monitoring boreholes set 10 m and 20 m downstream from the injection well may be considered as influenced by the experiment. A probable enrichment in HCO3 linked to interaction of the CO2 saturated water with chalk was noticed, with an enrichment close to +8 to +10% of the initial value. For one borehole the pH value remained nearly stable in relation with pH buffering and in the other borehole a slight decrease was observed (-0.1 to -0.15 pH unit). However this decrease is significant as it is above the instrumental uncertainty of the electrodes. In addition, a slight increase of the electrical conductivity was noticed but it did not exceed +6% compared to baseline data. Such slight changes in the physico-chemical parameters are related to small variations in dissolved elements. Apart from HCO3, the other major ion affected by CO2-water rock-interaction is Ca as the aquifer is mainly composed by calcite. Concentrations increases by +8 to +9% whose amplitude is in agreement with the increase of HCO3. Trace elements were also little affected, the main change concerned Sr (+8 to +10% increase). Modifications occurring during this CO2 release experiment have small amplitude as expected but these results highlight that geochemical methods are able to detect small leakages. Consequently, effects were noticed only during a short period of time. It is not possible to determine if all the injected CO2 has migrated downwards in the direction of flow or if partial lateral migration has occurred, but post-injection monitoring and boreholes logging 12 days after the stop of injection did not reveal any discrepancy in the water columns. On the other hand, the magnitude of the pH change is consistent with the behaviour of the co-injected tracer (dilution ratio 30).

Many studies have addressed the issue of the impact of climate change on viticulture in most wine regions worldwide, yet few studies are devoted to observing and simulating both climate and climate change at the terroir scale (local scale). However, phenological variations as well as differences in grapes/wine quality are often observed over short distances in a wine-region, which are related to local characteristics (slope, soil, seasonal climate ... ). This paper proposes a modeling approach to simulate behavior changes in wine grower activities and to analyze the impact of changing strategies in wine production. Two experiments were conducted in the small wine appellation grand cru Quart de Chaume (Coteaux du Layon, Loire Valley, France) and in the wine estate in Mendoza (Bodega Alta Vista) where all of the methodology (from the implementation of the knowledge database to the analysis of the first simulation) is presented.

Both magnetic and geochemical analyses were performed from the same discrete samples to avoid any artificial depth offset. The authigenic Be-10 concentrations were normalized with respect to Be-9 in order to correct for potential environmental effects, while the relative paleointensity was derived from the remanent magnetization intensity after accounting for changes in magnetic concentration within the sediment. The relative paleointensity and the Be-10/Be-9 records are both characterized by large deviations, which culminate in the middle of the reversal. In contrast to most previous studies, and despite relative high deposition rate (4.7 cm/ka), we observed a perfect synchronism between the Be-10/Be-9 peak, the lowest value of relative paleointensity and the switch in direction, which indicates that bioturbation and post-depositional processes did not affect the magnetic record. This leaves no ambiguity for the stratigraphic position of the reversal located within Marine Isotopic Stage 19 as revealed by the planktonic delta O-18 record from the same core. The magnetic data depict a two-phase process with a precursory event preceding the rapid polarity switch, while only the second phase is present in the Be-10 record, similarly to other low latitude records from the Indonesian area. Using an orbitally-tuned age model, we obtain an age of 772 ka +/- 5 ka for the middle of the transition, while the precursory event occurred almost 20 ka before. We believe that the bimodal distribution emerging from the compilations of the ages of the M-B reversal results from the succession of these two events. Microtektites from the Australasian impact were found at 0.6 m below the transition (790 ka +/- 5 ka B.P.) and confirm that this large event occurred 12 ka prior to the polarity transition. The distribution of tektite abundance was used to deconvolve the Be-10/Be-9 signal. The results confirm that the beryllium changes are concentrated during the transitional period, thus likely in presence of a multipolar geomagnetic field (or in the vicinity of a geomagnetic pole) that favored the penetration of cosmic rays and consequently increased the Be-10 production. The absence of Be-10 during the precursor indicates that the present site and the Indonesian ones were far away from a geomagnetic pole and that interlatitudinal atmospheric mixing was limited. The geomagnetic pole positions above the Indonesian sites during the precursor would thus be incompatible with the corresponding inclined dipolar field during this period, and suggest the dominance of low-degree harmonics.

The relationship between the monthly frequency of daily weather regimes (WRs) computed for the Euro-Atlantic region and monthly Mediterranean RPs is analysed over the 1979-2005 period. Overall, the NAO- WR is clearly associated with NWM, the NAO+ with MGD, the Atlantic Ridge (AR) with NAM and the East-Atlantic with W&SM. Over the 21st century, we find that the winter occurrence of WRs are not significantly modified under future RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 projection. Nevertheless, an eastward shift of the low pressure system during NAO- regimes, an eastward extension of Azores high pressure towards the Mediterranean during NAO+ regimes and an increase in high pressure over the Azores during AR regimes could strengthen the mean relationship between WRs and RPs. These within-class barometric changes in WRs are mainly observed under the RCP8.5 scenario and in the late 21st century, highlighting their strong dependence on radiative forcing over time.;"Mediterranean rainfall; weather regimes; climate change; CMIP5";"NORTH-ATLANTIC; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CIRCULATION CLASSIFICATION; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; IBERIAN RAINFALL; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; REGIONAL SCALES; WINTER CLIMATE; OSCILLATION; PRECIPITATION";Geosciences;Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences;"[Ullmann, A.; Fontaine, B.; Roucou, P.] CNRS, UMR Biogeosci 6282, Ctr Rech Climatol, Dijon, France";Ullmann, A (reprint author), CNRS, UMR Biogeosci 6282, Ctr Rech Climatol, Dijon, France.;France;France;FRA;1;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY;;;;;34;8;2634;2650;;10.1002/joc.3864;0899-8418;1097-0088;;0899-8418 eISSN: 1097-0088;;non;0;;oui;1;2014;Biogéosciences, UMR6282;Biogéosciences, UMR6282;UMR6282;UMR6282;4 - Excellente

Invasive ants are extremely difficult to control, and thus early detection is essential to prevent ant invasions, in particular through surveillance efforts at ports of entry. This paper assesses the potential distribution of 14 of the worst invasive ant species in France, under current and future climatic conditions. Consensus species distribution models, using five different modelling techniques, three global climate models and two CO2 emission scenarios, indicated that France presented suitable areas for 10/14 species, including five listed on the Invasive Species Specialist Group's selection of the world's 100 worst invasive species. Among these 10 species, eight were predicted to increase their potential range with climate change. Areas with the highest concentration of potential invaders were mainly located along the coastline, especially in the south-west of France, but all departments appeared to be climatically suitable for at least two invasive species. A ranking of climatic suitability per species for 17 major airports and 14 maritime ports indicated that the ports of entry with the highest suitability were located in Biarritz, Toulon and Nice, and the species with the greatest potential distribution in France were Lasius neglectus and Linepithema humile, followed by Solenopsis richteri, Pheidole megacephala and Wasmannia auropunctata.;"France; species distribution models; climate change; invasive ants; biological invasions";"LASIUS-NEGLECTUS HYMENOPTERA; IMPORTED FIRE ANT; YELLOW CRAZY ANT; BIG-HEADED ANT; PHEIDOLE-MEGACEPHALA; SOLENOPSIS-INVICTA; ARGENTINE ANT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NATIVE ANT; ANOPLOLEPIS-GRACILIPES";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Sciences";"[Bertelsmeier, Cleo; Courchamp, Franck] Univ Paris 11, UMR CNRS 8079, F-91405 Orsay, France";Bertelsmeier, C (reprint author), Univ Paris 11, UMR CNRS 8079, Bat 425, F-91405 Orsay, France.;France;France;FRA;1;ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION;;;;;41;2;217;228;;10.1017/S0376892913000556;0376-8929;1469-4387;;0376-8929 eISSN: 1469-4387;;non;0;;oui;1;2014;Ecologie, systématique et évolution (ESE), UMR8079;Ecologie, systématique et évolution (ESE), UMR8079;UMR8079;UMR8079;4 - Excellente

After 45 days of reaction, 56 wt % of the initial MgO had reacted with CO2 to form Fe-bearing magnesite, (Mg0.8Fe0.2)CO3, along with minor calcium carbonates. The substantial decrease in olivine content upon carbonation supports the idea that ferroan magnesite formation mainly follows from olivine dissolution. In contrast, in experiments performed under similar run durations and P/T conditions with a San Carlos olivine separate (47.8 wt % MgO) of similar grain size, only 5 wt % of the initial MgO content reacted to form Fe-bearing magnesite. The overall carbonation kinetics of the basalt was enhanced by a factor of ca. 40. This could be explained by differences in the chemical and textural properties of the secondary silica layer that covers reacted olivine grains in both types of sample. Consequently, laboratory data obtained on olivine separates might yield a conservative estimate of the true carbonation potential of olivine-bearing basaltic rocks.;;"DISSOLUTION KINETICS; FORSTERITE DISSOLUTION; DEGREES-C; TEMPERATURE; STORAGE; PH; CHEMISTRY; RELEVANT; INSIGHT; RATES";"Engineering; Environment/Ecology";"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences";"[Sissmann, Olivier; Martinez, Isabelle] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Inst Phys Globe Paris, CNRS,UMR 7154, F-75005 Paris, France; [Sissmann, Olivier; Pinquier, Yves] Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, Geol Lab, UMR 8538, F-75005 Paris, France; [Sissmann, Olivier] IFP Energies Nouvelles, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France; [Brunet, Fabrice] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Inst Sci Terre, UMR 5275, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France; [Guyot, Francois] Univ Paris 06, Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, Inst Mineral Phys Mat & Cosmochim,UMR 7590, F-75005 Paris, France; [Verlaguet, Anne] Univ Paris 06, ISTeP, UMR 7193, F-75005 Paris, France; [Daval, Damien] Univ Strasbourg, UMR 7517, CNRS, Lab Hydrol & Geochim Strasbourg,EOST, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Verlaguet, Anne] CNRS, ISTeP, UMR 7193, F-75005 Paris, France";Sissmann, O (reprint author), Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Inst Phys Globe Paris, CNRS,UMR 7154, 1 Rue Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France.;France;France;FRA;8;ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY;;;;;48;10;5512;5519;;10.1021/es405508a;0013-936X;1520-5851;;0013-936X eISSN: 1520-5851;;non;0;;oui;1;2014;"Ecole et Observatoire des sciences de la Terre (EOST), UMS830; Institut de Minéralogie, de Physique des Matériaux et de Cosmochimie (IMPMC), UMR7590; Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP), UMR7154; Institut des Sciences de la Terre (ISTerre), UMR5275; Institut des Sciences de la Terre Paris (iSTeP), UMR7193; Laboratoire d'Hydrologie et de Géochimie de Strasbourg (LHyGeS), UMR7517; Laboratoire de Géologie de l'Ecole Normale Supérieure, UMR8538";"Ecole et Observatoire des sciences de la Terre (EOST), UMS830; Institut de Minéralogie, de Physique des Matériaux et de Cosmochimie (IMPMC), UMR7590; Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP), UMR7154; Institut des Sciences de la Terre (ISTerre), UMR5275; Institut des Sciences de la Terre Paris (iSTeP), UMR7193; Laboratoire d'Hydrologie et de Géochimie de Strasbourg (LHyGeS), UMR7517; Laboratoire de Géologie de l'Ecole Normale Supérieure, UMR8538";"UMR5275; UMR7154; UMR7193; UMR7517; UMR7590; UMR8538; UMS830";"UMR5275; UMR7154; UMR7193; UMR7517; UMR7590; UMR8538; UMS830";4 - Excellente

Our approach offers a dynamic indicator of global warming potential (GWP), one of the most used indicator of environmental impacts (e.g. in the Kyoto Protocol). For a case study, the wheat production in France was selected and considered by using data from official sources about fertilizer consumption and production of wheat We propose to assess GWP environmental impact based on LCA method. The system boundary is limited to the fertilizer production for 1 ton of wheat produced (functional unit) from 1910 to 2010. As applied to wheat production in France, traditional LCA shows a maximum GWP impact of 500 kg CO2-eg for 1 ton of wheat production, whereas the GWP impact of wheat production over time with our approach to dynamic LCA and its cumulative effects increases to 18,000 kg CO2-eg for 1 ton of wheat production.

Since the early 1990s, sea level rose at a mean rate of similar to 3.1 mm yr(-1) (refs 2,3). However, over the last decade a slowdown of this rate, of about 30%, has been recorded(4-8). It coincides with a plateau in Earth's mean surface temperature evolution, known as the recent pause in warming(1,9-12). Here we present an analysis based on sea-level data from the altimetry record of the past similar to 20 years that separates interannual natural variability in sea level from the longer-term change probably related to anthropogenic global warming. The most prominent signature in the global mean sea level interannual variability is caused by El Nino-Southern Oscillation, through its impact on the global water cycle(13-16). We find that when correcting for interannual variability, the past decade's slowdown of the global mean sea level disappears, leading to a similar rate of sea-level rise (of 3.3 +/- 0.4mm yr(-1)) during the first and second decade of the altimetry era. Our results confirm the need for quantifying and further removing from the climate records the short-term natural climate variability if one wants to extract the global warming signal(10).;;"RIVER DISCHARGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EARTHS ENERGY; SURFACE; MODEL; GRACE";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences; Social Sciences";"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Cazenave, Anny; Dieng, Habib-Boubacar; Meyssignac, Benoit; Berthier, Etienne] Lab Etud Geophys & Oceanog Spatiales, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [von Schuckmann, Karina] Mediterranean Inst Oceanog, F-83957 La Garde, France; [Decharme, Bertrand] Meteo France, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, F-31100 Toulouse, France";Cazenave, A (reprint author), Lab Etud Geophys & Oceanog Spatiales, 18 Ave E Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France.;France;France;FRA;18;NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE;;;;;4;5;358;361;;10.1038/NCLIMATE2159;1758-678X;1758-6798;;1758-678X eISSN: 1758-6798;;non;0;;oui;1;2014;"Institut Méditerranéen d'Océanographie (MIO), UMR7294; Laboratoire d'études en Géophysique et océanographie spatiales (LEGOS), UMR5566";"Institut Méditerranéen d'Océanographie (MIO), UMR7294; Laboratoire d'études en Géophysique et océanographie spatiales (LEGOS), UMR5566";"UMR5566; UMR7294";"UMR5566; UMR7294";5 - Exceptionelle

This region has been identified as a climate change hot spot, and as a region where water demand is continuously increasing due to population growth and the expansion of irrigated areas. The Herault River catchment (2500 km(2), France) is a typical example and a negative trend in discharge has been observed since the 1960s. In this context, local stakeholders need to evaluate possible future changes in water allocation capacity in the catchment, using climate change, dam management and water use scenarios. A modelling framework that was already calibrated and validated on this catchment over the last 50 years was used to assess whether water resources could meet water demands at the 2030 horizon for the domestic, agricultural and environmental sectors. Water supply sustainability was evaluated at the sub-basin scale according to priority allocations using a water supply capacity index, frequency of unsatisfactory years as well as the reliability, resilience and sustainability metrics. Water use projections were based on the evolution of population, per-unit water demand, irrigated areas, water supply network efficiency, as well as on the evaluation of a biological flow. Climate projections were based on an increase in temperature up to 2 degrees C and a decrease in daily precipitation by 20%. Adaptation strategies considered reducing per-unit water demand for the domestic sector and the importation of water volume for the agricultural sector. The dissociated effects of water use and climatic constraints on water supply sustainability were evaluated. Results showed that the downstream portions would be the more impacted as they are the most exploited ones. In the domestic sector, sustainability indicators would be more degraded by climate change scenarios than water use constraints. In the agricultural sector the negative impact of water use scenarios would be stronger. The environmental sector would be hardly satisfied especially in summer with low resilience levels. The adaptation strategies considered in this study would not be sufficient to cope with both anthropogenic and climate changes. Other strategies were discussed based on known examples in the Mediterranean context. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This phenomenon could be attributed to the insertion of CO2 into gold, leading to the formation of a thick iono-metallic multi-strata layer (less conducting than pure metal) that grows with the electrode charge. The formation of this new interface is due to the concur of three elements: transient CO2 anion radical, the metal, and rather small-sized cations (M+ = Na+ or TMA(+)), the three possibly associated in a form {Au-CO2-,M+} apparently very reactive with oxygen, moisture, and with some organic it-acceptors. Upon multi-scans up to -2.2 V, the thickness of formed layer progressively increases reaching more than 10(-7) to 10(-6) mol cm(-2). Such multi-layers undergo decomposition in the anodic domain at about + 1.7 V liberating CO2 beforehand trapped in Au. Coulometric analyses demonstrated that insertion (cathodic) and release (anodic) steps are quite equivalent, which permits to consider this process as chemically reversible sequestration of carbon dioxide.

We proposed one of the first comprehensive frameworks tracking local changes in community composition related to climate changes. First, we investigated whether and how 12 years of changes in the local composition of bird communities were related to local climate variations. Then, we tested the consequences of this climate-induced adjustment of communities on Grinnellian (habitat-related) and Eltonian (function-related) homogenization. A standardized protocol monitoring spatial and temporal trends of birds over France from 2001 to 2012 was used. For each plot and each year, we used the spring temperature and the spring precipitations and calculated three indices reflecting the thermal niche, the habitat specialization, and the functional originality of the species within a community. We then used a moving-window approach to estimate the spatial distribution of the temporal trends in each of these indices and their congruency with local climatic variations. Temperature fluctuations and community dynamics were found to be highly variable in space, but their variations were finely congruent. More interestingly, the community adjustment to temperature variations was nonmonotonous. Instead, unexplained fluctuations in community composition were observed up to a certain threshold of climate change intensity, above which a change in community composition was observed. This shift corresponded to a significant decrease in the relative abundance of habitat specialists and functionally original species within communities, regardless of the direction of temperature change. The investigation of variations in climate and community responses appears to be a central step toward a better understanding of climate change effects on biodiversity. Our results suggest a fine-scale and short-term adjustment of community composition to temperature changes. Moreover, significant temperature variations seem to be responsible for both the Grinnellian and Eltonian aspects of functional homogenization.;"birds; community; functional; global change; homogenization; specialist; temperature";"BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; AVIAN ASSEMBLAGES; GLOBAL CHANGE; LIFE-HISTORY; MULTISCALE; RESPONSES; TRAITS; SCALE";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Gauezere, Pierre; Devictor, Vincent] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IRD, Inst Sci Evolut, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Jiguet, Frederic] Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR CESCO 7204, Ctr Rech Biol Populat Oiseaux, F-75005 Paris, France";Gauzere, P (reprint author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IRD, Inst Sci Evolut, Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier, France.;France;France;FRA;0;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;21;9;3367;3378;;10.1111/gcb.12917;1354-1013;1365-2486;;1354-1013 eISSN: 1365-2486;;non;0;;oui;1;2015;"Centre des Sciences de la Conservation (CESCO), UMR7204; Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier (ISEM), UMR5554";"Centre des Sciences de la Conservation (CESCO), UMR7204; Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier (ISEM), UMR5554";"UMR5554; UMR7204";"UMR5554; UMR7204";5 - Exceptionelle

Therefore, knowledge about grassland management practices in farming systems is needed for sustainable agriculture. In this context, the PaturMata model simulates grassland management at the farm scale. The PaturMata model simulates grassland dynamics and several factors such as farming practices, grass consumption, and fertilization. The model takes into account environmental and farming system parameters such as climate, field number, size, and location; livestock units; and conventional or organic agriculture. Here, we first ran the model under climatic conditions favorable to grass growth for four farms on an experimental site located in western France. Biophysical variables extracted from remote-sensing images were used to initialize PaturMata, whose predictions were compared to on-site surveys. We generated forecasting scenarios of the same farms under different climatic conditions. Results show that PaturMata predicts a 70 % decrease in grass consumption, a 50 % decrease in the number of annual grazing periods, and a 60 % increase in the amount of conserved forage consumed, when conditions are unfavorable to grass growth. We conclude that the PaturMata model can help design farms and management strategies capable of coping with a wide range of conditions.";"Grassland management strategies; Modeling of agricultural practices; Timed automata; Model checking; Remote sensing";"SYSTEMS; FRANCE";Agricultural Sciences;Agronomy;"[Dusseux, Pauline; Corpetti, Thomas; Hubert-Moy, Laurence] Univ Rennes 2, UMR CNRS 6554, LETG Rennes COSTEL Lab, F-35043 Rennes, France; [Zhao, Yulong; Cordier, Marie-Odile] Univ Rennes 1, IRISA UMR 6074, Inria, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Delaby, Luc] INRA, UMR Prod Lait 1348, F-35590 St Gilles, France; [Gascuel-Odoux, Chantal] INRA, UMR Sol Agro & Hydrosyst Spatialisat 1069, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Gascuel-Odoux, Chantal] Agrocampus Ouest, F-35000 Rennes, France";Dusseux, P (reprint author), Univ Rennes 2, UMR CNRS 6554, LETG Rennes COSTEL Lab, Pl Recteur Henri Le Moal, F-35043 Rennes, France.;France;France;FRA;0;AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT;;;;;35;3;1087;1093;;10.1007/s13593-015-0295-0;1774-0746;1773-0155;;1774-0746 eISSN: 1773-0155;;non;0;;oui;1;2015;"Institut de recherche en informatique et systèmes aléatoires (IRISA), UMR6074; Littoral, environnement, télédétection et géomatique (LETG), UMR6554";"Institut de recherche en informatique et systèmes aléatoires (IRISA), UMR6074; Littoral, environnement, télédétection et géomatique (LETG), UMR6554";"UMR6074; UMR6554";"UMR6074; UMR6554";5 - Exceptionelle

Using an original regional database, we apply the panel cointegration tests and estimation of Pedroni (Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics S1 61:653-670, 1999; Review of Economics and Statistics 89:727-731, 2001) to estimate the long-run effects. We find that an increased annual temperature decreases both cereal and date productions, with an exception in highland areas. In addition, the annual rainfall has a positive effect on cereals, but rain shortages in the south affect production negatively in this region. The short-run climate effects are smaller than the long-run effects. The rainfall has a weak positive effect that is counterbalanced by the threat of brutal temperature increases over the last decades. This paper calls for the implementation of a public policy privileging and subsidizing the threatened areas. Adaptation measures should include the implementation of a water demand management system that promotes using scarce water resources more efficiently. Moreover, policy makers should seriously consider encouraging the development of drought-tolerant crops, especially in the south of Tunisia where global warming has caused a severe drought.

Assuming that the ancient concept of active versus passive rifting remains pertinent as end-members of more complex processes, we show that the progressive Pangea breakup occurred through a succession of rifting episodes characterized by different tectonic evolutions. A first episode of passive continental rifting during the Upper Carboniferous and Permian led to the formation of the Neo-Tethys Ocean. Then at the beginning of Triassic times, two short episodes of active rifting associated to the Siberian and Emeishan large igneous provinces (LIPs) failed. The true disintegration of Pangea resulted from (1) a Triassic passive rifting leading to the emplacement of the central Atlantic magmatic province (200Ma) LIP and the subsequent opening of the central Atlantic Ocean during the lowermost Jurassic and from (2) a Lower Jurassic active rifting triggered by the Karoo-Ferrar LIP (183Ma), which led to the opening of the West Indian Ocean. The same sequence of passive then active rifting is observed during the Lower Cretaceous with, in between, the Parana-Etendeka LIP at 135Ma. We show that the relationships between the style of rifts and their breakdown or with the type of resulting margins (as magma poor or magma dominated) are not straightforward.

However, specific geomorphological reef types (fringing, barrier, atoll, bank for the main ones) can be vulnerable to specific disturbances that will not affect most other reefs. This has implications for local management and science priorities. Several geomorphologically closed atolls of the Pacific Ocean have experienced in recent decades mass benthic and pelagic lagoonal life mortalities, likely triggered by unusually calm weather conditions lasting for several weeks. These events, although poorly known, reported, and characterized, pose a major threat for resource sustainability. Based on a sample of eleven events on eight atolls from the central South Pacific occurring between 1993 and 2012, the conservative environmental thresholds required to trigger such events are identified using sea surface temperature, significant wave height and wind stress satellite data. Using these thresholds, spatial maps of potential risk are produced for the central South Pacific region, with the highest risk zone lying north of Tuamotu Archipelago. A regional climate model, which risk map compares well with observations over the recent period (r=0.97), is then used to downscale the projected future climate. This allows us to estimate the potential change in risk by the end of the 21(st) century and highlights a relative risk increase of up to 60% for the eastern Tuamotu atolls. However, the small sample size used to train the analysis led to the identification of conservative thresholds that overestimated the observed risk. The results of this study suggest that long-term monitoring of the biophysical conditions of the lagoons at risk would enable more precise identification of the physical thresholds and better understanding of the biological processes involved in these rare, but consequential, mass mortality events.;"climate change; CMIP-3; CMIP-5; coral reef; dystrophy; Pacific Ocean; sea surface temperature; significant wave height; wind stress";"ARCHIPELAGO FRENCH-POLYNESIA; TUAMOTU ARCHIPELAGO; TROPICAL CYCLONES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PACIFIC-OCEAN; WAVE CLIMATE; EL-NINO; REEF; COMMUNITIES; VARIABILITY";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Andrefouet, Serge; Dutheil, Cyril] LABEX CORAIL, Inst Rech Dev, UR CoReUs 227, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Dutheil, Cyril; Menkes, Christophe E.] Univ Paris 06, IRD, Univ Paris 04, CNRS MNHN IPSL,LOCEAN Lab, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Bador, Margot] Sci Univers CERFACS, CERFACS CNRS, URA 1875, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Lengaigne, Matthieu] Univ Paris 06, Univ Paris 04, CNRS IRD MNHN, LOCEAN Lab,IPSL, Paris, France";Andrefouet, S (reprint author), LABEX CORAIL, Inst Rech Dev, UR CoReUs 227, BP A5, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia.;"France; New Caledonia";France;FRA;1;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;21;1;195;205;;10.1111/gcb.12699;1354-1013;1365-2486;;1354-1013 eISSN: 1365-2486;;non;0;;oui;1;2015;"Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire d'Océanographie et du Climat : Expérimentations et Approches Numériques (LOCEAN), UMR7159; Sciences de l'Univers au CERFACS (SUC), URA1875";"Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), FR636; Laboratoire d'Océanographie et du Climat : Expérimentations et Approches Numériques (LOCEAN), UMR7159; Sciences de l'Univers au CERFACS (SUC), URA1875";"FR636; UMR7159; URA1875";"FR636; UMR7159; URA1875";5 - Exceptionelle

The method is currently considered as a potential tool for and climate change adaptation against increasing heat wave intensity and frequency. However, although water consumption necessary to implement this technique is an important aspect for decision makers, optimization of possible watering methods has only rarely been conducted. An analysis of pavement heat flux at a depth of 5 cm and solar irradiance measurements is proposed to attempt to optimize the watering period, cycle frequency and water consumption rate of a pavement-watering method applied in Paris over the summer of 2013. While fine-tuning of the frequency can be conducted on the basis of pavement heat flux observations, the watering rate requires a heat transfer analysis based on a relation established between pavement heat flux and solar irradiance during pavement insolation. From this, it was found that watering conducted during pavement insolation could be optimized to 30-min cycles and water consumption could be reduced by more than 80% while reducing the cooling effect by less than 13%.

The Pyrenees are expected to undergo strong environmental perturbations over the 21st century because of climate change (rising temperatures) and the abandonment of agro-pastoral areas (reforestation). Both changes are happening at similar timescales and are expected to have an impact on snow cover. The effect of climate change on snow in the Pyrenees is well understood, but the effect of land cover changes is much less documented. Here, we analyze the response of snow cover to a combination of climate and land cover change scenarios in a small Pyrenean catchment (Bassies, 14.5 km(2), elevation range 940-2651 m a.s.l.) using a distributed snowpack evolution model. Climate scenarios were constructed from the output of regional climate model projections, whereas land cover scenarios were generated based on past observed changes and an inductive pattern-based model. The model was validated over a snow season using in situ snow depth measurements and high-resolution snow cover maps derived from SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre - Earth Observation Satellite) satellite images. Model projections indicate that both climate and land cover changes reduce the mean snow depth. However, the impact on the snow cover duration is moderated in reforested areas by the shading effect of trees on the snow surface radiation balance. Most of the significant changes are expected to occur in the transition zone between 1500 m a.s.l. and 2000 m a.s.l. where (i) the projected increase in air temperatures decreases the snow fraction of the precipitation and (ii) the land cover changes are concentrated. However, the consequences on the runoff are limited because most of the meltwater originates from high-elevation areas of the catchment, which are less affected by climate change and reforestation.

An approach involving 2 successive downscaling steps is proposed here as a first attempt to simulate precipitation over a small orographic island. First, the 50 km mesh global atmospheric model ARPEGE is forced by bias-corrected sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from a CMIP5 scenario. This model drives the limited area model ALADIN. The final 12 km mesh regional simulation coarsely captures the island of Tahiti. Historical and scenario runs (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) are therefore available at the island scale. Linking station data and historical model outputs using quantile-quantile plots allows a correction of the biases of the regional simulation and an assessment of precipitation changes over the 21st century. For both scenarios, mean austral summer precipitation tend to increase over the century on the south-east side of Tahiti, following the present El Nina-like precipitation pattern. This trend could be a local manifestation of the large-scale drift of the tropical Pacific Ocean towards an El Nina-like spatial structure. This drift is indeed verified in the SST fields. Then, superimposed upon this slowly evolving mean state, future LA Nina events would cause positive precipitation anomalies, whereas future La Nina events would cause negative precipitation anomalies. However, in the last period of RCP8.5, future El Nina events do not seem to affect precipitation anymore, suggesting a damping of the warm events, probably due to a warmer mean state.;"South Pacific; Regional climate simulation";"CIRCULATION MODEL; PRECIPITATION; SCHEME; PARAMETERIZATION; SIMULATIONS; ATMOSPHERE; FRAMEWORK; IMPACTS; OUTPUTS";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Hopuare, M.; Ortega, P.] GePaSud Lab, Tahiti, Fr Polynesia; [Hopuare, M.; Pontaud, M.; Deque, M.] CNRS, Meteo France, GAME UMR 3589, Toulouse, France; [Ceron, J. -P.] Meteo France, Direct Climatol, Toulouse, France";Hopuare, M (reprint author), GePaSud Lab, Tahiti, Fr Polynesia.;"France; French Polynesia";France;FRA;0;CLIMATE RESEARCH;;;;;63;3;233;247;;10.3354/cr01298;0936-577X;1616-1572;;0936-577X eISSN: 1616-1572;;non;0;;oui;1;2015;Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), UMR3589;Groupe d'étude de l'atmosphère météorologique (GAME), UMR3589;UMR3589;UMR3589;2 - Acceptable

A hybrid general equilibrium model (Imitcum-R) is used to investigate numerically the interaction between technical change and economic growth. Energy efficiency in productive sectors lowers energy prices. Lower energy prices increase demand due to lower prices of non-energy goods and higher household revenues. Energy efficiency lowers the carbon price, shifting the emission constraint away from household energy consumption. Energy efficiency policies drive economic growth and reduce policy costs, but only if energy efficiency policies in industrialised regions are combined with measures to accelerate technology transfers towards other regions. The timing of efforts reveals a trade-off between short and long term costs. Early action triggers energy efficiency but shows high short-term costs and should be considered in combination with policies to accelerate technology diffusion. Late action shows high long-term costs, even when combined with policies to enhance innovation and accelerate diffusion. Early action could reduce the cost uncertainty induced by the controversy surrounding the appropriate discount rate for policy assessment, while late action would require additional measures to reduce long term costs, notably in sectors with significant inertia.

Shift in species distribution is likely to be one of the major possible adaptations to changing environmental conditions. Habitat models based on a unique long-term tracking dataset of king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) breeding on the Crozet Islands (southern Indian Ocean) revealed that despite a significant influence of primary productivity and mesoscale activity, sea surface temperature consistently drove penguins' foraging distribution. According to climate models of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the projected warming of surface waters would lead to a gradual southward shift of the more profitable foraging zones, ranging from 25 km per decade for the B1 IPCC scenario to 40 km per decade for the A1B and A2 scenarios. As a consequence, distances travelled by incubating and brooding birds to reach optimal foraging zones associated with the polar front would double by 2100. Such a shift is far beyond the usual foraging range of king penguins breeding and would negatively affect the Crozet population on the long term, unless penguins develop alternative foraging strategies.;"habitat model; penguins; polar front; distribution shift; IPCC climate models";"RECENT CLIMATE-CHANGE; EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSES; POLAR FRONT; IMPACTS; HABITAT; ARCHIPELAGO; CIRCULATION; FISHERIES; PREDATORS; DYNAMICS";"Biology & Biochemistry; Environment/Ecology; Plant & Animal Science";"Biology; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology";"[Peron, Clara; Weimerskirch, Henri; Bost, Charles-Andre] CNRS, UPR 1934, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Bost, Charles-Andre] ULP, CNRS, UMR 7178, Inst Pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien,DEPE, F-67087 Strasbourg 2, France";Peron, C (reprint author), CNRS, UMR 5175, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.;France;France;FRA;17;PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES;;;;;279;1738;2515;2523;;10.1098/rspb.2011.2705;0962-8452;;;0962-8452;;non;0;;oui;1;2012;"Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175; Centre d'études biologiques de Chizé (CEBC), UPR1934; Institut pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien (IPHC), UMR7178";"Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (CEFE), UMR5175; Centre d'études biologiques de Chizé (CEBC), UMR7372; Institut pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien (IPHC), UMR7178";"UMR5175; UMR7178; UPR1934";"UMR5175; UMR7178; UMR7372";4 - Excellente

Alpine snowbeds, i.e. alpine tundra from late snowmelt sites, might be particularly susceptible to such climatic changes. Snowbed communities were grown in large monoliths for two consecutive years, under different manipulated snow cover treatments, to test for effects of early (E) and late (L) snowmelt on dominant species growth, plant functional traits, leaf area index (LAI) and aboveground productivity. Spring snow cover was reduced to assess the sensitivity of snowbed alpine species to severe early frost events, and dominant species freezing temperatures were measured. Aboveground biomass, productivity, LAI and dominant species growth did not increase significantly in E compared to L treatments, indicating inability to respond to an extended growing season. Edapho-climatic conditions could not account for these results, suggesting that developmental constraints are important in controlling snowbed plant growth. Impaired productivity was only detected when harsher and more frequent frost events were experimentally induced by early snowmelt. These conditions exposed plants to spring frosts, reaching temperatures consistent with the estimated freezing points of the dominant species (similar to-10 degrees C). We conclude that weak plasticity in phenological response and potential detrimental effects of early frosts explain why alpine tundra from snowbeds is not expected to benefit from increased growing season length.;"Alopecurus gerardi; alpine tundra; Carex foetida; early frost; growing season length; Poa alpina";"SIMULATED CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; PLANT-RESPONSES; CAREX-BIGELOWII; EUROPEAN ALPS; ARCTIC TUNDRA; NITROGEN; VEGETATION; ECOSYSTEM; TRAITS";Plant & Animal Science;Plant Sciences;"[Baptist, F.; Flahaut, C.; Choler, P.] Univ Grenoble, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS UJF, UMR 5553, F-38041 Grenoble 09, France; [Streb, P.] Univ Paris Orsay, UFR Sci Orsay, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, Orsay, France; [Choler, P.] Univ Grenoble, Stn Alpine J Fourier, CNRS UJF, UMR 2925, F-38041 Grenoble 09, France";Baptist, F (reprint author), Univ Grenoble, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS UJF, UMR 5553, BP 53, F-38041 Grenoble 09, France.;France;France;FRA;16;PLANT BIOLOGY;;;;;12;5;755;764;;10.1111/j.1438-8677.2009.00286.x;1435-8603;;;1435-8603;;non;0;;oui;1;2010;"Ecologie, systématique et évolution (ESE), UMR8079; Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553; Station alpine Joseph Fourier (SAJF), UMS3370";"Ecologie, systématique et évolution (ESE), UMR8079; Laboratoire d'écologie alpine (LECA), UMR5553; Station alpine Joseph Fourier (SAJF), UMS3370";"UMR5553; UMR8079; UMS3370";"UMR5553; UMR8079; UMS3370";3 - Correcte

L.";AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Volume: 30 Issue: 2 Pages: 215-236 Published: 2010;English;Review;Dairy production systems represent a significant source of air pollutants such as greenhouse gases (GHG), that increase global warming, and ammonia (NH(3)), that leads to eutrophication and acidification of natural ecosystems. Greenhouse gases and ammonia are emitted both by conventional and organic dairy systems. Several studies have already been conducted to design practices that reduce greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions from dairy systems. However, those studies did not consider options specifically applied to organic farming, as well as the multiple trade-offs occurring between these air pollutants. This article reviews agricultural practices that mitigate greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions. Those practices can be applied to the most common organic dairy systems in northern Europe such as organic mixed crop-dairy systems. The following major points of mitigation options for animal production, crop production and grasslands are discussed. Animal production: the most promising options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the livestock management level involve either the improvement of animal production through dietary changes and genetic improvement or the reduction of the replacement rate. The control of the protein intake of animals is an effective means to reduce gaseous emissions of nitrogen, but it is difficult to implement in organic dairy farming systems. Considering the manure handling chain, mitigation options involve housing, storage and application. For housing, an increase in the amounts of straw used for bedding reduces NH(3) emissions, while the limitation of CH(4) emissions from deep litter is achieved by avoiding anaerobic conditions. During the storage of solid manure, composting could be an efficient mitigation option, depending on its management. Addition of straw to solid manure was shown to reduce CH(4) and N(2)O emissions from the manure heaps. During the storage of liquid manure, emptying the slurry store before late spring is an efficient mitigation option to limit both CH(4) and NH(3) emissions. Addition of a wooden cover also reduces these emissions more efficiently than a natural surface crust alone, but may increase N(2)O emissions. Anaerobic digestion is the most promising way to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions from storage and land spreading, without increasing NH(3) emissions. At the application stage, NH(3) emissions may be reduced by spreading manure during the coolest part of the day, incorporating it quickly and in narrow bands. Crop production: the mitigation options for crop production focus on limiting CO(2) and N(2)O emissions. The introduction of perennial crops or temporary leys of longer duration are promising options to limit CO(2) emissions by storing carbon in plants or soils. Reduced tillage or no tillage as well as the incorporation of crop residues also favour carbon sequestration in soils, but these practices may enhance N(2)O emissions. Besides, the improvement of crop N-use efficiency through effective management of manure and slurry, by growing catch crops or by delaying the ploughing of leys, is of prime importance to reduce N(2)O emissions. Grassland: concerning grassland and grazing management, permanent conversion from arable to grassland provides high soil carbon sequestration while increasing or decreasing the livestock density seems not to be an appropriate mitigation option. From the study of the multiple interrelations btween gases and between farm compartments, the following mitigation options are advised for organic mixed crop-dairy systems: (1) actions for increasing energy efficiency or fuel savings because they are beneficial in any case, (2) techniques improving efficiency of N management at field and farm levels because they affect not only N(2)O and NH(3) emissions, but also nitrate leaching, and (3) biogas production through anaerobic digestion of manure because it is a promising efficient method to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, even if the profitability of this expensive investment needs to be carefully studied. Finally, the way the farmer implements the mitigation options, i.e. his practices, will be a determining factor in the reduction of greenhouse gas and NH(3) emissions.;"agriculture; greenhouse gas; ammonia; abatement; mixed crop-dairy systems; organic; livestock; manure; grassland; carbon storage; soil carbon sequestration";"NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; RUMINANT LIVESTOCK SYSTEMS; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; METHANE EMISSIONS; FARMING SYSTEMS; SOIL CARBON; PIG SLURRY; AGRICULTURAL SOILS; ANIMAL HUSBANDRY; CATTLE SLURRY";Agricultural Sciences;Agronomy;"[Novak, S.

Kinetic measurements were performed using a gravimetric experimental set-up, which allows measurement of gas density. Sorption equilibrium is reached faster for CO2 than CH4. The differences are mainly due to the physico-chemical parameters of both gas molecules and their coal-interactions. The pressure-dependence of diffusion parameters in coals was shown. Increasing gas pressure decreases the equilibrium time. For example, the CO2 equilibrium time is about 15 h at 5 MPa and about 40 h for 0.1 MPa. The study of kinetic sorption at different temperatures suggested that the diffusion of gases into coal is activated for CO2 and CH4. The effective diffusion, De, and the diffusion coefficient, D, estimated from modelling experimental data by assuming Fickian and unipore diffusion, increased with increasing temperature. The diffusion coefficient was estimated at about 10(-12) m(2) s(-1). Assuming Arrhenius' law, the activation energy of CO2 adsorption was rather low, about 18 kJ mol(-1) compared to the one of CH4. about 34 kJ mol(-1). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A literature search shows that grassland C sequestration reaches on average 5 +/- 30g C/m(2) per year according to inventories of SOC stocks and -231 and 77g C/m(2) per year for drained organic and mineral soils, respectively, according to C flux balance. Off-site C sequestration occurs whenever more manure C is produced by than returned to a grassland plot The sum of on- and off-site C sequestration reaches 129, 98 and 71g C/m(2) per year for grazed, cut and mixed European grasslands on mineral soils, respectively, however with high uncertainty. A range of management practices reduce C losses and increase C sequestration: (i) avoiding soil tillage and the conversion of grasslands to arable use, (ii) moderately intensifying nutrient-poor permanent grasslands, (iii) using light grazing instead of heavy grazing, (iv) increasing the duration of grass leys; (v) converting grass leys to grass-legume mixtures or to permanent grasslands. With nine European sites, direct emissions of N2O from soil and of CH4 from enteric fermentation at grazing, expressed in CO2 equivalents, compensated 10% and 34% of the on-site grassland C sequestration, respectively. Digestion inside the barn of the harvested herbage leads to further emissions of CH4 and N2O by the production systems, which were estimated at 130g CO2 equivalents/m(2) per year The net balance of on- and off-site C sequestration, CH4 and N2O emissions reached 38g CO2 equivalents/m(2) per year, indicating a non-significant net sink activity. This net balance was, however, negative for intensively managed cut sites indicating a source to the atmosphere. In conclusion, this review confirms that grassland C sequestration has a strong potential to partly mitigate the GHG balance of ruminant production systems. However as soil C sequestration is both reversible and vulnerable to disturbance, biodiversity loss and climate change, CH4 and N2O emissions from the livestock sector need to be reduced and current SOC stocks preserved.";"climate change; CO2; N2O; CH4; soil organic carbon";"SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE; CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ELEVATED CO2; TEMPERATE GRASSLAND; PLANT DIVERSITY; SEMINATURAL GRASSLAND; MANAGEMENT INTENSITY";Plant & Animal Science;"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences";"[Soussana, J.

Consequently, there is a crucial need for an efficient tool for field water budget diagnosis to enable forest managers to estimate tree survival and productivity. Robust estimates of water budget using soil and topography were compared for their ability to predict site yield of Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. Site yield was estimated using site index at 100 years. Ninety-nine even-aged high-forest stands located in northern France were investigated. Water budget was estimated by topographic position and soil water capacity (SWC) calculated for different soil depths down to a maximum 2.0 m. (1) Site index predictions improved when calculating SWC for increasing depths until 1.0 m. (2) Site index predictions did not improve when calculating SWC at depths below 1.0 m, thus confirming that the water contained in deep soil layers is not used for tree growth but probably contributes to tree fitness or survival by maintaining a not too negative in-tree water potential. (3) Topographic position was also a predictor of site index in addition to SWC.

However, there is a general lack of consideration of the impact of climate change on soil evolution. We propose here to use agricultural soil drainage-that also increases the amount of water flowing through soils-as an analogy to climate change. We thus studied the impact of 16 years of agricultural drainage in one cropped plot of the most common type of soils of Northern Europe. To estimate the importance of the soil evolution induced by drainage, we compared it to the long term natural evolution of that soil. The recent increase in water fluxes by agricultural drainage (16 years) has resulted in an increase in the intensity and velocity of the natural pedological processes. The increased amount of water flowing thorough soils due to drainage is of same order of magnitude than that that would be induced by climate change in the next 50-100 years in northern Europe. Our results demonstrated thus that climate change will significantly affect soil evolution. This evolution induces losses of the finest particles involved in organic carbon sequestration and thus has a feedback effect on climate change. Therefore we consider that soil evolution in response to climate change has to be explicitly studied and included in models predicting global climate change.;;"MASS-BALANCE; AGRICULTURAL DRAINAGE; SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE; WATER-QUALITY; VERTISOL; EROSION; FEEDBACKS; IMPACTS; GENESIS; USA";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Montagne, David] INRA AgroParisTech Environm & Grandes Cultures, UMR, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Montagne, David; Cornu, S.] Ctr Rech Orleans, INRA, UR0272, F-45166 Olivet, France";Montagne, D (reprint author), INRA AgroParisTech Environm & Grandes Cultures, UMR, Batiment Eger,BP 01, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.;France;France;FRA;2;CLIMATIC CHANGE;;;;;98;1-2;75;86;;10.1007/s10584-009-9666-3;0165-0009;;;0165-0009;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

M.; Baculat, B.; Brisson, N.";VIII INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TEMPERATE ZONE FRUITS IN THE TROPICS AND SUBTROPICS Bokk Series: Acta Horticulturae Volume: 872 Published: 2010;English;Proceedings Paper;Different models to estimate the chilling requirements of floral buds in deciduous fruit trees are available, although they have rarely been compared one with the other. Moreover, the mathematical functions and associated parameters involved in chilling models are frequently chosen rather arbitrarily. This work therefore aimed to improve the choice of the chilling model by comparing in same conditions three contrasting models on the basis of biological measurements of completion of chilling requirements. The first one was the sum of hours when temperature is below or equal to the threshold of 7 degrees C (binary model). The second one was the sum of Chill Units considering weighting effects of temperatures (comparable to a normal function). The third one was the sum of Chill Actions calculated according to an exponential function of temperature, proposed by Bidabe in France (1967). The time-course variations of mean growth of apricot floral primordia were established for nine annual cycles in same orchard conditions of the lower Rhone valley for 'Rouge du Roussillon'. The estimated date of end of the slow growth of floral primordia was assimilated each year to the mean date of completion of chilling requirements. Thus, for each model and each year, sums of chilling effects were calculated from fixed or variable dates (according to model) in the early autumn to the estimated date of chilling completion. A relatively high variance of the annual sum of chilling effects calculated in hours below 7 degrees C was clearly highlighted (coefficient of variation >20%). On the other hand, lower variances were obtained for the annual sums of Chill Units and Chill Actions (coefficient of variation around 6-9%). These results corroborate previous works emphasizing the unreliability of sums of hours below 7 degrees C to estimate chilling requirements in fruit trees, although this model is always mainly used in breeding and orchard management. They therefore suggest that breeders and growers could test other chilling models, as Chill Units and Chill Actions, faced with a probable varietal adaptation to global warming in the near future.;"floral primordia; dormancy; modelling; global warming";"FLOWERING TIME; EVOLUTION; TREE";"Agricultural Sciences; Plant & Animal Science";"Plant Sciences; Horticulture";"[Legave, J.

The overall aim was to simulate the meat and milk production of cattle (suckler cows with their calves, dairy cows and heifers) in response to climate and management, as well as feedbacks to the atmosphere through enteric methane emissions. Herbage intake at grazing was calculated from animal characteristics, herbage availability, diet digestibility and air temperature. With suckler cows, milk production and changes in daily liveweight and body condition were calculated from net energy balance. The net energy intake of dairy cows and their body reserves at turnout to pasture were used to simulate milk production at pasture, daily liveweight and body condition changes, taking into account cow energy requirements and intake capacity. Heifer growth was determined from heifer net energy intake and liveweight. Net energy intake was used to assess enteric methane production through a conversion factor, which depends both on the energy level of the diet and on the herbivore type. The model was assessed against experimental data for animal performance and methane emissions at grazing. Predictions show good agreement with observations. On average, the root mean square error was 6.5, 4 and 2.5% for the liveweights of suckler cows, suckler calves and heifers, respectively, 18% for dairy milk production and 12% for enteric methane emissions. By comparing this new version of the PaSim model to the previous version, we show that a greater accuracy in animal performance modelling improves the sensitivity of the model to interannual climate variability. However, long term (30 years) projections of climate change impacts on grasslands and of radiative feedbacks to the atmosphere are not significantly modified. The originality and the validity domain of the model are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The major issue comes from CO2 dilution (4% for NGCC and 14% for PC) and the high flow rates to be treated. Furthermore, CO2 purity has to be higher than 95% with recovery at 90%, to match the transportation/injection requirements. The MEA absorption process remains the reference today but its energy consumption (about 3 MJ/kg(CO2)) and the amine consumption are still challenging drawbacks. The interest of CO2 capture by indirect TSA (Temperature Swing Adsorption) was demonstrated experimentally in a previous work. The aim of this paper is to present the results of a numerical parametric study. Two main parameters are explored: the desorption temperature (100-200 degrees C) and the purge flow rate (0.1-0.5 Ndm(3) min(-1)). Four performance indicators are evaluated: CO2 purity, recovery, productivity and specific energy consumption. Results show that purity above 95% can be achieved. Keeping the 95% target, it is possible to achieve recovery at 81% with productivity at 57.7 g(CO2)/kg(ads) h and a specific energy consumption of 3.23 MJ/kg(CO2), which is less than for the reference MEA process. Comparison with other adsorption processes exhibits that this process has good potential especially since some improvements are still expected from further research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The consumption of N(2)O by strains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum (USDA110 and MSDJ G49) was investigated both on inoculated soybean plants cultivated in soil pots during a greenhouse experiment and on detached nodules submitted to gradients of oxygen and N(2)O concentrations in laboratory conditions. During the greenhouse experiment, we switched from a system acting as an N(2)O source (soil + soybean inoculated with a nosZ gene depleted strain) to a system acting as an N(2)O sink (soil + soybean inoculated with strains carrying the nosZ gene). Nodules of Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110 and MSDJ G49 were both able to reduce N(2)O under aerobic conditions at rates increasing with N(2)O concentrations. Calculations using the obtained quantitative results clearly suggest an environmental benefit of this process on the field scale.

None of them would even imagine savanna replacing one day the Mediterranean forest. First of all, it seems sensible not to interpret microclimatic variations (neither within the time nor in the space) as manifestations of the macroclimate evolution, where several factors interact. On the other hand, when you listen to practitians, there is an increasing prevalence and one can notice a modification in the scale of the made sensitive subjects' ages which can strikingly interfere on the effect of a potential climate change. Then, a rather difficult variable to understand is the impact of a climatic variation on the behavior of a given botanical species. Indeed each population, in a same taxon, owns an ecological amplitude, that is to say a room for maneuver in terms of adaptation to a climate change. Thus, it is not very rational to predict for each region that plant landscape will completely change, but on the contrary, one must take into consideration the fact that some modifications can have an incidence on the pollinosis: the Cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) could become allergenic out of the Mediterranean zone. At the moment, it is present outside but non-active. The Ambroisia (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) as well does not cause any problem outside the Rhone corridor on our territory. This situation can be modified by elevating or changing the amplitude of temperatures but also by the variation of the humidity rate. The case of allergenic plants will be considered as well as their behavior according to the climate in the different regions. The multiplicity of the factors to be considered shows that the climate change is only one of them amongst all the others, with no effect on the short term but probably to be taken into account on the century scale.

This tick plays an important role as vector for various animal and human pathogens, including bacteria and protozoa. Based on precise daily meteorological data from the past 40 years, combined with mathematical modelling designed to predict tick activity, two modelling approaches were developed. The first examined the evolution of the number of weeks with favourable biological conditions for ticks in four French cities located at various latitudes of the country: Nimes in the south, Paris in the north, Lyon in the east and Nantes in the west. The second analysed the extension of the geographical surface area in km(2) where the biological conditions favour tick activity for at least 12 weeks per year. Both analyses revealed clear evidence of increased temperatures coupled with an augmented tick activity index in three of the four cities. However, the change was not significant in Nimes, where the climate is Mediterranean and the tick is already endemic. For Paris, Lyon and Nantes, the activity index values have increased significantly, i.e. by 4.4%, 4.0% and 3.4%, respectively. The distribution of the activity index values is evolving strongly with significantly fewer values below 50% since the 1960s and a clear decrease of values between 20% and 50% during the latest decade. Between 1960 and 2000, the theoretical extension of the surface area where the climatic index is suitable for R. sanguineus has increased by 66%. Even though several other important factors, such as changes in biotopes or human activity, are not included in this study, the resulting patterns and trends are noticeable. Our models constitute the first demonstration of the impact of climate change on the activity and distribution of ticks and confirm the observed northward migration trend for this Mediterranean domestic tick.;"Rhipicephalus sanguineus; mathematical modelling; climate change; epidemiology; France";"BORNE DISEASES; IXODES-RICINUS; PATHOGENS; EMERGENCE; ECOLOGY; EUROPE";"Clinical Medicine; Social Sciences";"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health";"[Beugnet, Frederic] Merial, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Kolasinski, Michel; Michelangeli, Paul-Antoine; Vienne, Julien; Loukos, Harilaos] CLIMPACT, F-75009 Paris, France";Beugnet, F (reprint author), Merial, 29 Av Tony Garnier, F-69007 Lyon, France.;France;France;FRA;11;GEOSPATIAL HEALTH;;;;;5;2;255;263;;;1827-1987;;;1827-1987;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;2 - Acceptable

The experiments were repeated at various pressures, temperatures and salinities that are representative of conditions prevailing during CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers. The dependence of CO2/brine IFT on pressure and temperature is similar to that previously reported for the systems: CO2/NaCl solution and CO2/CaCl2 solution. CO2/brine IFT increases linearly with water salinity and the magnitude of this increase was found equal to the sum of the individual CO2/NaCl solution and CO2/CaCl2 solution IFT increments, indicating a strong additive effect on IFT when the brine is composed of various salts.

The aim of this study was to determine the importance of the three main drivers of climate change (warming, summer drought, and elevated CO(2) concentrations) on N(2)O fluxes from an extensively managed, upland grassland. Over a 2-year period, we monitored N(2)O fluxes in an in situ ecosystem manipulation experiment simulating the climate predicted for the study area in 2080 (3.5A degrees C temperature increase, 20% reduction in summer rainfall and atmospheric CO(2) levels of 600 ppm). N(2)O fluxes showed significant seasonal and interannual variation irrespective of climate treatment, and were higher in summer and autumn compared with winter and spring. Overall, N(2)O emissions showed a positive correlation with soil temperature and rainfall. Elevated temperature had a positive impact on mean annual N(2)O fluxes but effects were only significant in 2007. Contrary to expectations, neither combined summer drought and warming nor the simultaneous application of elevated atmospheric CO(2) concentrations, summer drought and warming had any significant effect on annual N(2)O fluxes. However, the maximum N(2)O flux rates observed during the study occurred when elevated CO(2) was combined with warming and drought, suggesting the potential for important, short-term N(2)O-N losses in enriched CO(2) environments. Taken together, our results suggest that the N(2)O responses of temperate, extensively managed grasslands to future climate change scenarios may be primarily driven by temperature effects.;"drought; elevated CO(2); grasslands; interannual variation; nitrous oxide emission; warming";"DIFFERENTLY MANAGED GRASSLANDS; ELEVATED ATMOSPHERIC CO2; FILLED PORE-SPACE; N2O EMISSIONS; SOIL-MICROORGANISMS; BIOMASS PRODUCTION; WATER-CONTENT; LAND-USE; ECOSYSTEM; FERTILIZATION";Environment/Ecology;Ecology;"[Cantarel, Amelie A.

Studies to break this limitation follow two main paths: formulation of new solvents and optimization of the process flowsheet. The purpose of this works is to assess the impact of the different flowsheet modifications and power plant integration on the plant performance. CO2 capture amine plant has been integrated in a gross electrical 1200 MWe supercritical coal-fired power plant; a process optimization study coupled with economical and availability analysis has been performed for each studied case and compared to a reference case: standard amine capture process with 30% wt MEA. The capture plant increases the cost of a new power plant by approximately 70% and the electricity price by 45%. Process flowsheet optimization on the amine capture plant do no significantly increase the specific power plant cost (from 0 to 2%) with CO2 capture, the additional expenditure are compensated with the plant efficiency gains. The cost of electricity is, also, almost not affected by the flowsheet optimization (from -2.5 to + 1.5 %). The best tested configuration allows a reduction of 10% of the cost of avoided CO2. The addition of a capture plant increases by approximately 1.4% pt the risk of forced outage factor and therefore decreases the whole power plant availability by the same value. The effects of the availability decreases due to the capture plant on CO2 and electricity prices are negligible. This work shows that these modifications alone are not sufficient to enable an economically feasible carbon capture on coal fired power plant despites a loss of efficiency of approximately 10% pt. The goal of less than 5% pt efficiency losses induced by post combustion carbon capture need a combination of new solvent and optimized process or a totally new breakthrough process.

The European Directive on the geological storage of carbon dioxide specifies the safety strategy to be adopted. Notably, a corrective measure plan is required in order to mitigate the potential significant irregularities. In this paper, we describe one measure that could be applied in case of an unexpected abnormal behavior of the gas plume (e. g. leakage of CO2). The objective is to trap the mobile gaseous CO2 as quickly as possible; among all the trapping mechanisms occurring after CO2 injection, capillarity trapping is the fastest and we then focused on its enhancement and improvement. The intervention strategy consists in injecting brine through the former CO2 injection well in order to accelerate the wetting of the CO2 plume. We run simulations through a 1D-axisymetric model in order to evaluate the efficiency of such a measure; the results are sensitive towards brine injection rates and other site-specific key parameters but, in any case, the measure set-up leads to a rapid immobilization of the gaseous CO2 in comparison with a simple relaxation. The consequences of the pressure build-up in terms of hydraulic and mechanic risks are not critical in the base case simulation conditions and thus do not compromise the applicability of the corrective measure.

This project delivers new conclusions about the safety role of the permafrost and specific conditions of storage in an area of abnormal geothermal gradient in Western Siberia. One of the specific issues of the project was the potential formation of carbon dioxide hydrates from the injected CO2 and the possible reaction between the existing methane hydrates and the injected CO2. Maps have been constructed showing the areas of CO2 hydrate stability. A second specific issue was the compatibility of CO2 storage in the permafrost with oil production. Pilot tests of EOR technologies, involving either the injection of CO2 or the generation of CO2 in situ, proved very efficiency for high-viscosity oil pools. Therefore, we propose to inject CO2 in West Siberia into high-viscosity oil fields. High-viscosity oil fields are mainly located in the centre of the Western Siberian Basin in Khanty-Mansijsk autonomous okrug (KMAO). An alternative or complementary solution is storage in aquifers. Deep aquifers, such as the Pokur formation overlain could also be storage targets, but their potential is unknown because they have not been explored in detail. The inventory of major CO2 sources in Western Siberia has shown that the major CO2 emission in the power sector comes from the KMAO, where power stations in Surgut and Nizhnevartovsk are large CO2 sources. GIS mapping of the permafrost depth and thickness, and the associated stability domain of the CO2 hydrates, has shown that a good overlap could exist between these industrial areas and the stability domain of the gas hydrates, underneath the permafrost. Storage beneath the permafrost as CO2 hydrate is not suitable due to the probable rapid plugging of the porosity by solid gas hydrates. But, the CO2 should be stored at supercritical state in the hydrocarbon fields, with added value of heavy oil upgrading, and trapped underneath a classical cap rock. In addition, the permafrost would act as a secondary cap-rock by trapping the CO2 as hydrates if the primary caprock should fail.

Other outcomes were the development of innovative methods for capacity assessment, economic modelling and site selection. An important mission was to initiate scientific collaboration, with China and other CSLF members (e. g. Russia). In China, the study was applied to the Hebei Province, which is located in the Bohai Basin, NE China. The inventory of emission sources was performed for the entire Hebei Province, while storage potential was studied in one of the major tectonic units of the basin, the Jizhong depression, in the south of the Province. The distribution of the main CO2 emitters by sector has shown that besides the power sector, industry must be considered, in particular iron/steel and cement sectors accounting for one third of the total. Least cost transport was calculated using a methodology developed by 3E/INET (Tsinghua University) and BRGM ([1] Chen et al., 2010) and applied also to the other CCS projects in China. The NZEC Conference, held in Beijing (28-20 October 2009) to close phase 1 and launch phase 2 of this European programme in China, concluded that storage is the most critical issue. At the present early stage, low-cost capture and transport should be preferred. Therefore, should incentives, performing investigation tools and adequate partnership be in place, several small-scale demonstration projects from local industry to local storage sites are recommended to improve knowledge and operating conditions prior to any ambitious project. CCS deployment in the Hebei province could be performed from local sources to local sinks of CO2. However, EOR is limited by the present water cut or reservoir geometry and geothermal reconversion might be profitable. Tertiary aquifers would be a good target, but the Neogene (Guantao, Minghuazhen formations) seems restricted to other uses (geothermal, water supply).

As a result they represent an important scale for assessment and understanding of climate change impacts. This paper provides a conceptual and methodological framework for urban economic impact assessment of climate change. The focus of the paper is on model-based analysis of future scenarios, including a framing of uncertainty for these projections, as one valuable input into the decision-making process. The paper highlights the main assessment difficulties, methods and tools, and selected examples across these areas. A number of challenges are unique to climate change impact assessment and others are unique to the problem of working at local scales. The paper also identifies the need for additional research, including the need for more integrated and systemic approaches to address climate change as a part of the urban development challenge as well as the need to assess the economic impacts of climate change and response policy at local scale.;;"SEA-LEVEL RISE; UNITED-STATES; MODEL PROJECTIONS; EUROPEAN CLIMATE; AIR-POLLUTION; DAMAGE COSTS; URBAN; ADAPTATION; SIMULATION; SCENARIOS";"Environment/Ecology; Geosciences";"Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences";"[Hallegatte, Stephane] Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, Paris, France; [Hallegatte, Stephane] Ecole Natl Meteorol, Toulouse, France; [Henriet, Fanny; Corfee-Morlot, Jan] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Paris, France";Hallegatte, S (reprint author), Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, Paris, France.;France;France;FRA;21;CLIMATIC CHANGE;;;;;104;1;51;87;;10.1007/s10584-010-9976-5;0165-0009;;;0165-0009;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

A.";SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY Volume: 43 Issue: 1 Pages: 86-96 Published: 2011;English;Article;"It is increasingly recognized that soil microbes have the ability to decompose old recalcitrant soil organic matter (SOM) by using fresh carbon as a source of energy, a phenomena called priming effect (PE). However, efforts to determine the consequences of this PE for soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics are in their early stage. Moreover, little is known about the microbial populations involved. Here we explore the consequences of PE for SOM dynamics and mineral nitrogen availability in a soil incubation experiment (161 days), combining the supply of dual-labeled (C-13 and C-14) cellulose and mineral nutrients. The microbial groups involved in PE were investigated using molecular fingerprinting techniques (FAMES and B- and F-ARISA). We show that mean residence time of SOM pool controlled by the PE decreased from 3130 years in the subsoil, where the availability of fresh carbon is very low, to 17-39 years in the surface layer. This result suggests that the decomposition of this recalcitrant soil C pool is strictly dependent on the presence of fresh C and is not an energetically viable mean of accessing C for soil microbes. We also suggest that fungi are the predominant actors of cellulose decomposition and induced PE and they adjust their degradation activity to nutrient availability. The predominant role of fungi can be explained by their ability to grow as mycelium which allows them to explore soil space and mine large reserve of SOM. Finally, our results support the existence of a bank mechanism that regulates nutrient and carbon sequestration in soil: PE is low when nutrient availability is high, allowing sequestration of nutrients and carbon; in contrast, microbes release nutrients from SOM when nutrient availability is low. This bank mechanism may help to synchronize the availability of soluble nutrients to plant requirement and contribute to long-term SOM accumulation in ecosystems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Studying the consequences of climate change on crop production needs associating several sub-models dealing with: (i) greenhouse actuators control, (ii) greenhouse climate and (iii) tomato plant growth models. We have used a combined greenhouse climate and crop model to predict hourly greenhouse climate and energy and mass fluxes and their consequences on crop production for future (2070-2099) and past (1960-1979) climate in Avignon region (South-France). The future climate corresponds to a moderate climate change scenario (+2.2 degrees C average temperature rise) and the past one to measured climate data. Comparison of preliminary results for future and past climate conditions has evidenced an average yearly air temperature rise of 1 degrees C only in the greenhouse, as against 2.2 degrees C outside. It is principally due to more elevated outside temperatures in winter, resulting in a 30% energy saving for greenhouse heating. However, considering only summer time, air temperature rise exceeds 2.2 degrees C. If we do not consider CO2 concentration rise, this temperature elevation generates negative impacts on tomato growth: both on LAI (-10%), fruit weight (-8%) and global yield (-7%), together with an increase of the plant stress duration. However, considering also the CO2 concentration elevation from 380 presently to 700 ppm in the future, one finally predicts a 20% yield increase, still with a substantial increase of the plant stress duration. This study highlights the major consequences of climate change on greenhouse production, either positive (energy saving, yield increase) or negative (greenhouse temperature rise, summer plant stress). It suggests possible adaptations of greenhouse control and management strategies, methods and new research directions for limiting the negative impacts, particularly on fruit quality.;"greenhouse; climate; change; tomato; crop; France";;"Agricultural Sciences; Plant & Animal Science";"Agricultural Engineering; Horticulture";"[Boulard, T.; Fatnassi, H.] INRA, UR880, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France";Boulard, T (reprint author), INRA, UR880, 400 Route Chappes, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France.;France;France;FRA;0;XXVIII INTERNATIONAL HORTICULTURAL CONGRESS ON SCIENCE AND HORTICULTURE FOR PEOPLE (IHC2010): INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ENGINEERING THE MODELLING, MONITORING, MECHANIZATION AND AUTOMATION TOOLS FOR PRECISION HORTICULTURE;Acta Horticulturae;28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People (IHC) / International Symposium on Engineering the Modelling, Monitoring, Mechanization and Automation Tools for Precision Horticulture;AUG 22-27, 2010;Lisbon, PORTUGAL;919;;71;80;;;0567-7572;;978-90-66055-64-3;0567-7572;28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People (IHC) / International Symposium on Engineering the Modelling, Monitoring, Mechanization and Automation Tools for Precision Horticulture Date: AUG 22-27, 2010 Location: Lisbon, PORTUGAL;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;0 - Sans notoriété

It notes the widespread recognition of the importance of cities and local governments to this agreement and describes the many challenges to including these governments within it - technical, political and economic. There are also the difficulties in reaching agreement on how targets can take into account differences in capacity to act and differences in the sectors where city governments have jurisdiction. As the post-2012 climate change negotiations are already a highly complicated process, the inclusion of sub-national governments into the agreement needs to constitute a solution rather than a new problem.

Efficient health surveillance systems are required to support adaptation to climate change. However, despite a growing awareness, the public health surveillance sector has had very little involvement in the drafting of adaptation plans. This paper proposes a method to raise awareness about climate change in the public health community, to identify possible health risks and to assess the needs for reinforced health surveillance systems. Methods: A working group was set up comprising surveillance experts in the following fields: environmental health; chronic diseases and; infectious diseases. Their goal was to define common objectives, to propose a framework for risk analysis, and to apply it to relevant health risks in France. Results: The framework created helped to organize available information on climate-sensitive health risks, making a distinction between three main determinants as follows: (1) environment; (2) individual and social behaviours; and (3) demography and health status. The process is illustrated using two examples: heatwaves and airborne allergens. Conclusion: Health surveillance systems can be used to trigger early warning systems, to create databases which improve scientific knowledge about the health impacts of climate change, to identify and prioritize needs for intervention and adaptation measures, and to evaluate these measures. Adaptation requires public health professionals to consider climate change as a concrete input parameter in their studies and to create partnerships with professionals from other disciplines.

Climate change is rarely taken into consideration in conservation management strategies aimed at protecting biodiversity from other threats. We examined the implications of this perspective in European calcareous grasslands, which are among the richest herbaceous systems of the continent and are therefore of high nature conservation interest. These systems are currently undergoing species loss because of the abandonment of agro-pastoral practices. Classic ecological theory assumes that conservation management activities (such as regular mowing) and drought events should increase diversity through decreased plant competition in abandoned mesic communities. In turn, this could reduce diversity in xeric communities although positive plant interactions (facilitation) might buffer these negative effects and maintain diversity. 2. We studied the effects of regular mowing and experimentally induced drought on diversity and biotic interactions between two transplanted species in mesic and xeric calcareous grasslands. The study sites in south-western France have not been subjected to any management for the last 30 years. 3. Drought did not affect mesic systems although mowing increased plant diversity through decreased competition. By contrast, mowing had no significant effect in xeric systems although drought decreased diversity. Interestingly, transplants were subject to neither competition nor facilitation in the xeric systems. 4. Synthesis and applications. Regular mowing and drought events impact plant diversity of mesic and xeric calcareous grassland communities in different ways. We recommend regular mowing of mesic grasslands, even in the context of climate change. By contrast, we recommend less-frequent mowing of xeric grasslands together with specific interventions such as assisted migration for species with poor drought tolerance. Similar studies in other ecosystems on larger spatial and temporal scales should examine the dual effects of management and climate change to identify appropriate management programmes.;"biotic interactions; conservation; diversity; drought; Mesobromion; mowing; Xerobromion";"BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; CHALK GRASSLAND; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; HERBACEOUS VEGETATION; STRESS GRADIENTS; CONSERVATION; STRATEGIES; FACILITATION";Environment/Ecology;Ecology;"[Maalouf, Jean-Paul] Univ Bordeaux 1, UMR BIOGECO INRA 1202, F-33405 Talence, France; INRA, UMR BIOGECO INRA 1202, FR-33612 Cestas, France";Maalouf, JP (reprint author), Univ Bordeaux 1, UMR BIOGECO INRA 1202, Bat B2 RDC Est,Ave Fac, F-33405 Talence, France.;France;France;FRA;8;JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY;;;;;49;4;795;802;;10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02151.x;0021-8901;;;0021-8901;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

Numerous studies have used only climate variables to predict future potential species range shifts and have omitted environmental factors important for determining species distribution. Here, we assessed the importance of the edaphic dimension in the niche-space definition of Quercus pubescens and in future spatial projections under global change over the metropolitan French forest territory. We fitted two species distribution models (SDM) based on presence/absence data (111 similar to 013 plots), one calibrated from climate variables only (mean temperature of January and climatic water balance of July) and the other one from both climate and edaphic (soil pH inferred from plants) variables. Future predictions were conducted under two climate scenarios (PCM B2 and HadCM3 A2) and based on 100 simulations using a cellular automaton that accounted for seed dispersal distance, landscape barriers preventing migration and unsuitable land cover. Adding the edaphic dimension to the climate-only SDM substantially improved the niche-space definition of Q. pubescens, highlighting an increase in species tolerance in confronting climate constraints as the soil pH increased. Future predictions over the 21st century showed that disregarding the edaphic dimension in SDM led to an overestimation of the potential distribution area, an underestimation of the spatial fragmentation of this area, and prevented the identification of local refugia, leading to an underestimation of the northward shift capacity of Q. pubescens and its persistence in its current distribution area. Spatial discrepancies between climate-only and climate-plus-edaphic models are strengthened when seed dispersal and forest fragmentation are accounted for in predicting a future species distribution area. These discrepancies highlight some imprecision in spatial predictions of potential distribution area of species under climate change scenarios and possibly wrong conclusions for conservation and management perspectives when climate-only models are used.;"bio-indication; cellular automaton; downy oak; generalized additive model (GAM); migration; simRShift; soil pH; spatial fragmentation; species refugia";"BIOCLIMATE ENVELOPE MODELS; CONSERVATION BIOGEOGRAPHY; GLACIAL REFUGIA; PLANT ECOLOGY; SOIL; TREE; PREDICTION; DISPERSAL; FORESTS; FUTURE";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Bertrand, Romain; Perez, Vincent; Gegout, Jean-Claude] AgroParisTech, ENGREF, Lab Etud Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, UMR1092, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Bertrand, Romain; Perez, Vincent; Gegout, Jean-Claude] Ctr Nancy, INRA, Lab Etud Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, UMR1092, F-54280 Champenoux, France";Bertrand, R (reprint author), AgroParisTech, ENGREF, Lab Etud Ressources Foret Bois LERFoB, UMR1092, 14 Rue Girardet, F-54000 Nancy, France.;France;France;FRA;16;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;18;8;2648;2660;;10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02679.x;1354-1013;1365-2486;;1354-1013 eISSN: 1365-2486;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;5 - Exceptionelle

Two environmental impacts, climate change and non-renewable energy use, were estimated from the database according to the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The large variability observed seems to be linked to production orientation and geographic location. Livestock production was strongly correlated with the impact of climate change, particularly cattle production, due to its high emissions of enteric methane. Farms specialized in cereals and cash crops showed high non-renewable energy use, linked with intensive use of mineral fertilizers. Some mixed farm holdings, whether livestock-oriented or crop-and livestock-oriented, had impacts similar to those of the specialized farming system which each of them resembled most. Impacts varied according to geographic location in France. For farms specialized in cereals or dairy production, direct greenhouse gas emissions and indirect energy consumption predominated. Impacts for specialized dairy farms varied greatly per unit of agricultural area ( hectares) but less per 1,000 euros of revenue. In contrast, impact variability for specialized cereal farms was lower per hectare but considerably greater per 1,000 euros. Continuing the study will be useful for improving methods and results of these farming systems. It will also be interesting to consider more detailed methods to understand mixed crop-livestock farms, as these systems are widespread.;"agriculture; climate change; databases; energy for agriculture; life cycle analysis";;Agricultural Sciences;"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Agronomy";"[Samson, Elisabeth; Dupraz, Pierre; Ruas, Jean-Francois] INRA, UMR SMART 1302, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Samson, Elisabeth; Dupraz, Pierre; Ruas, Jean-Francois] Agrocampus Ouest, UMR SMART 1302, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Van der Werf, Hayo M.

In one experimental condition, the tree possessed its foliage whereas in the other, the branches were bare. It was found that participants were more likely to believe in global warming in presence of the tree without foliage (Study 1), that this belief increased in presence of three rather than one tree without foliage (Study 2), and that other beliefs not related to global warming were not affected by the experimental conditions. These results reveal that surrounding physical cues do affect beliefs about global warming. The spreading activation theory is used to explain these results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Zones with these conditions produce fruit for the global market. However, banana production, mainly for national markets, has developed in many subtropical areas under less than optimum conditions. Bananas are an important cash crop in southern Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina, in countries of North Africa, the Middle East and southern Africa, and in China and northern India. In these regions, bananas are subject to sub-optimum temperatures and short days. Highly favorable temperatures and long days in the summer may also include short periods of extreme temperatures above 35 degrees C, while rainfall is also highly variable. The effects of climate change on selected subtropical production areas were modeled in a two-step procedure using the EcoCrop model, under current growing conditions and for 2020 and 2050 using a set of 19 IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Global Climate Models (GCMs) under the SRES-A2 (business as usual) emission scenario. The modeling showed that current suitability for banana production in the subtropics is much lower than in the tropics with great variation in suitability within the subtropics. Of nine subtropical regions considered, two have improved conditions by 2020s, four are largely unaffected and three have a lower suitability. Our analysis also showed that, in terms of environmental conditions, certain sites are widely represented globally, offering options for technology transfer between sites.

Climate change will only exacerbate problems in a region already stressed by lack of water, food and political and social unrest. Across the Arc of Crisis, from Somalia, Sudan and Egypt in Africa to Yemen, Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan in West Asia, water scarcity in the region has already lead to drought and famine, loss of livelihood, the spread of water-borne diseases, forced migrations and open conflict. Water scarcity is closely linked to food and health security, making better water management a key stepping stone for poverty reduction and economic growth. If nothing changes, most of the WANA countries will encounter, in less than a generation, serious problems in managing inland freshwater, the availability of which, in sufficient quantity and quality, may become, as it is already the case in several of these countries, a main challenge for economic and social development. Wastage and pollution will then be such that water stress will affect, in a way or another, most of the populations of WANA countries and the poorest first of all. The effects of global warming will increase current trends. On the other hand, water scarcity in the WANA region is an issue of growing concern. With heavy demand from agriculture, growing populations and virtually no remaining untapped water sources, the need to establish water-management strategies in the region is of vital importance. WANA countries can be divided into three major agro-ecologies, each facing slightly different challenges. Rain-fed areas are dependent on a low and extremely variable rainfall, resulting in minimal yields, a problem exacerbated by frequent drought. Rainfall occurs in the form of intense and unpredictable storms, and as a result, the crusting soils are unable to absorb the moisture, which rapidly becomes lost through evaporation or runoff. Irrigated areas utilize rivers and groundwater sources, which are becoming depleted from over-use. Water scarcity is a manmade phenomenon brought about by the increasing demands of the population for water. The imbalance in the population-water resources equation strains society and has an adverse impact on domestic hygiene, public health, and cost of domestic water, and could impart political problems as serious as bringing down governments. On the social side, water scarcity adversely impacts job opportunities, farm incomes, credibility and reliability of agricultural exports, and the ability of the vulnerable to meet the cost of domestic water. Economically, the adverse impact is displayed in the loss of production of goods, especially agricultural goods, the loss of working hours because of the hardships society faces as a result of water scarcity. Thus, there is a need for preventive policy in the context of water security, and a process of networking to exchange the views of experts and specialists in this area, because, there is considerable knowledge of water scarcity in the WANA region, but what is needed is to consider ways that contribute to addressing this scarcity.

However, it is feared that such linking will induce outsourcing of emissions reduction at a low price and undermine the price incentive in the cap-and-trade. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is the first full-scale example of a cap-and-trade system linked to project-based mechanisms such that offsets have effectively been used by industrial installations. This article is an ex post analysis of EU ETS data for the years 2008 and 2009, and the characteristics of the link and its efficiency are evaluated. Although offsets have been much used, their use is concentrated and not very intense or frequent, which allays the fear that offsets will flood the market. Although the majority of surrendered CERs effectively come from the largest and oldest projects, the credits surrendered are similar to those available on the market. Possible factors that contribute towards inefficiency are the rules for using offsets, transaction costs affecting the participation of small installations, awareness and openness to market-based instruments, and uncertainties regarding CERs offer and demand from other markets. However, the impact on EUA equilibrium price still needs to be quantified.;"cap-and-trade; Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); EU Emissions Trading Scheme; flexible mechanism; linking";;"Environment/Ecology; Social Sciences";"Environmental Studies; Public Administration";Univ Paris 09, Climate Econ Chair, F-75002 Paris, France;Trotignon, R (reprint author), Univ Paris 09, Climate Econ Chair, 4th Floor,28 Pl Bourse, F-75002 Paris, France.;France;France;FRA;2;CLIMATE POLICY;;;;;12;3;273;287;;10.1080/14693062.2011.637820;1469-3062;;;1469-3062;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

Improvement of power plant efficiency due to higher steam condition is frequently foreseen to outbalance the carbon capture penalty. This work focuses on the conceptual design of two coal-fired power plants using CO2 as working fluid: one with postcombustion MEA-based CO2 capture and one with oxy-combustion CO2 capture with cryogenic air separation. Two maximal supercritical CO2 temperatures are investigated (620 and 700 degrees C). The combination of a Brayton supercritical CO2 power cycle, a coal boiler and a capture process allows significant increase of the overall plant efficiency. Both post-combustion and oxy-combustion capture processes lead to a very high overall plant efficiency: approximately 41.5% for a 620 degrees C power cycle and 44.5% for a 700 degrees C power cycle. Oxy-combustion seems best fitted for supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle due to a simpler thermal integration and the CO2 purification devices already integrated in the CO2 processing unit. Main resulting technological challenges are the very large heat exchanger needed in the CO2 cycle in order to achieve high power cycle efficiency and the development of supercritical CO2 turbine significantly different than steam or gas turbine especially because of the very large effort on wheel and the small size of the equipment. Numerous technological developments on process component will be necessary and a representative CO2 cycle pilot plant will be needed to assess CO2 leakage, corrosion and flexibility issues.

The capture process considered is the conventional two columns configuration with MEA solvent. A regeneration pressure range from 0.06 to 2.5 bar have been investigated. The thermal integration with the power plant has been performed on a new built, advanced supercritical power plant adapted for CO2 capture. Flue gases condensation heat and CO2 compression heat have been fully integrated in the steam cycle. Influence of stripper pressure on optimal lean loading ratio and columns basic design (height and diameter) have been investigated, with a focus on the influence of the CO2 compression heat integration strategy. Calculations of plant efficiency have been completed by simplified economical calculations for the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and avoided CO2 (LCCO2) in order to assess the industrial interest of stripper vacuum operation. Regarding plant efficiency the optimal pressure is at the minimum value: i.e. 0.06 bar with a loss of efficiency of 7.6 %pt. In the pressure range from 0.5 bar (medium vacuum) to 2.5 bar (standard stripper pressure), plant efficiency is quite stable with a minimum around atmospheric pressure with 9.4 %pt loss of efficiency. Regarding plant economics the main impact of vacuum regeneration is not the cost of the larger stripper but the cost of the very large compressor needed to maintain vacuum condition. At very low pressure, absorber and stripper have the same operating temperature therefore the economizer is no longer needed. Coupled with the improved plant efficiency, the effect of pressure on cost of electricity and cost of avoided CO2 is very small. The expected gain for deep vacuum stripper is not large enough to justify pilot demonstration of such operating parameters. (C) 2013 The Authors.

This pilot entails the conversion of an existing steam boiler into an oxy-fuel combustion unit, oxygen being used for combustion rather than air to obtain a more concentrated CO2 stream easier to capture. Then CO2 stream is compressed and conveyed via pipeline to the Rousse depleted gas field, 29 kilometers away, where it is injected into a deep carbonate reservoir. CO2 injection started earlier 2010 as all the proper official authorizations have been given. An appropriate monitoring plan is conducted to check the site integrity and storage performance. A preliminary baseline, conducted one year before the start of the injection is used as reference to detect any anomalous behavior which could be linked to any CO2 leakage. The aim of this paper is to present, the main lessons learned from the monitoring of the CCS pilot site of Lacq, after more than two years of injection and a year pre-injection baseline, in terms of monitoring-models offsets, security and risk analysis.

Among surface techniques allowing the observation of the entire storage complex, it has by far the greatest vertical and lateral resolution and it can provide a full 3D view of the reservoir and overburden. However, in our experience, theoretical applicability of seismic acquisition for CO2 plume tracking has often been challenged by the geology: high rock stiffness, heterogeneity, large depths, or low porosity in a storage site are not favorable factors. Moreover, there is uncertainty on the minimum levels of detectability. CO2 might mix either homogeneously or create patches of variable saturation, and this can result in a large variability on the expected seismic signal, especially for saturations lower than 50%. We investigate the seismic signal expected for a location in the Gippsland Basin, Victoria, Australia. Using classical rock physics equations, CO2 detectability at the reservoir level will present some challenges, but the possibility for detection above the reservoir is quite favorable. An understanding of the relative heterogeneity of storage formations is critical to establishing uncertainty and detection limits of time-lapse seismic technology. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Based on numerical simulations performed using TOUGH2/ECO2N incl. hysteretic module, we assess the processes influencing the quantity of mobile CO2 within the leaking plume and perform a sensitivity analysis to point out the key-parameters and conditions for an efficient natural trapping by dissolution and residual trapping. Additional simulations of a leak active remediation scenario on a complete system (storing reservoir connected to an overlying aquifer) show the importance of the natural trapping capacity of the overlying aquifer. This capacity could be integrated in the mitigation strategy, associating natural and engineered safety barriers. Gaining more knowledge on these formations can support first estimations of this natural capacity, and hence can help building the corrective measure plan and designing potential interventions during operations.

In a first approach, the potential consequences of climate change were evaluated in a direct quantitative way, however with high uncertainties in the final evaluation. Recognizing that uncertainties could hardly be reduced, a second assessment based on a multi-criteria evaluation was then undertaken. Geomorphological and marine factors that account for physical vulnerability to coastal hazards were evaluated for 21 coastal entities in metropolitan France. The evaluation was structured using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP).

In order to assess the impact of the expected warming, we developed a strategy for the definition of warming scenarios in coastal habitats and their potential sub-lethal to lethal impacts on key benthic species. This was achieved by combining numerical simulations under IPCC-A2 scenario with field observations and thermo-tolerance experiments. First, a model validation was conducted for the period 2001-2008 in contrasted coastal areas. Then, scenarios forecast run temperature outputs were analyzed in order to explore the expected changes in the stratification by the end of the 21st century.

This study uses data from: 1) standardised shipboard surveys (1980-2002), 2) standardised stranding surveys (1980-2002) and 3) landings of fishing fleets (2000-2002) in the Bay of Biscay. It investigates the correlations between stranding, at-sea encounter rate and the fishing index for three common cetaceans: common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas). At the monthly scale, a seasonal stranding pattern significantly congruent with the at-sea encounter rate and the fishing index for D. delphis is revealed. At the inter-annual scale, stranding and at-sea encounter rates are shown to be correlated (p = 0.013-0.044 according to species) and significantly increasing in abundance. Temporal variation in the ratio between individuals seen alive at sea and those stranded shows no significant trend suggesting that stranding is better explained by at-sea abundance than by the fishing index. Managers can use these findings to re-evaluate the relative contribution of by-catch fisheries in the context of observed changes of at-sea cetacean abundance and the link to oceano-climatic changes and other anthropogenic causes.

Within this project, two mountainous drainage basins located in the Pyrenees were examined to assess the specific impact of climate change on reservoir management. The Salat River basin at Roquefort, is considered as a proxy (representative of a natural basin), whereas the Ariege River at Foix is influenced by hydropower production in winter and by water releases to sustain low flows in summer. The Cequeau rainfall-runoff model, combined with a simplified model of reservoir management operations, was calibrated on present-day conditions and forced with climate projections derived from the IPCC AR4 report. The results show that a warming climate over the basins induces a decrease in mean annual runoff, a shift to earlier snow melting in mountainous areas and more severe low-flow conditions. The simulations show a decrease in electricity generation. Under two water management scenarios (one business-as-usual and the other incorporating an increased downstream water demand in compliance with requirements for increased minimum flow), simulations for the Ariege River basin suggest an earlier filling of the reservoir is necessary in winter to anticipate the increased release from reservoirs in summer to support minimum flow farther downstream.

In the case of agricultural pests, such range shifts may heavily impact agriculture. Species distribution modelling may help to predict potential changes in pest distributions. However, these modelling strategies are subject to large uncertainties coming from different sources. Here we used the case of the tomato red spider mite (Tetranychus evansi), an invasive pest that affects some of the most important agricultural crops worldwide, to show how uncertainty may affect forecasts of the potential range of the species. We explored three aspects of uncertainty: (1) species prevalence; (2) modelling method; and (3) variability in environmental responses between mites belonging to two invasive clades of T. evansi. Consensus techniques were used to forecast the potential range of the species under current and two different climate change scenarios for 2080, and variance between model projections were mapped to identify regions of high uncertainty. We revealed large predictive variations linked to all factors, although prevalence had a greater influence than the statistical model once the best modelling strategies were selected. The major areas threatened under current conditions include tropical countries in South America and Africa, and temperate regions in North America, the Mediterranean basin and Australia. Under future scenarios, the threat shifts towards northern Europe and some other temperate regions in the Americas, whereas tropical regions in Africa present a reduced risk. Analysis of niche overlap suggests that the current differential distribution of mites of the two clades of T. evansi can be partially attributed to environmental niche differentiation. Overall this study shows how consensus strategies and analysis of niche overlap can be used jointly to draw conclusions on invasive threat considering different sources of uncertainty in species distribution modelling.";;"PRESENCE-ONLY DATA; GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY; PSEUDO-ABSENCE DATA; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SOUTHERN AFRICA; HABITAT MODELS; EVOLUTIONARY; PERFORMANCE; CHALLENGES; IMPACTS";Multidisciplinary;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"[Meynard, Christine N.; Migeon, Alain; Navajas, Maria] UMR CBGP INRA IRD Cirad Montpellier SupAgro, INRA, Montferrier Sur Lez, France";Meynard, CN (reprint author), UMR CBGP INRA IRD Cirad Montpellier SupAgro, INRA, Campus Int Baillarguet, Montferrier Sur Lez, France.;France;France;FRA;5;PLOS ONE;;;;;8;6;;;e66445;10.1371/journal.pone.0066445;1932-6203;;;1932-6203;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

(2007) Energy Convers. Manage. 48, 1782-1797; Gunter et al. (1999) Appl. Geochem. 4, 1-11]. However because of the lack of data, these reservoirs are always partially known and the fitted variograms of petrophysical and mineralogical quantities are approximate. The aim is to quantify the impact of uncertainties on reservoir characteristics on the storage predictions. We focus on two operational parameters: the quantity of the stored carbon dioxide and the mean variation of the porosity. Two sources of uncertainties are examined: the draw dispersion and the approximation on the variogram parameters. To study the influence of the draw dispersion, variogram parameters are kept fixed and different simulations are run; the associated variance on the operational parameters then has the meaning of a repeatability error. In the second case, a sensibility analysis is carried out to study the influence of vario gram parameters variations (sill, range, nugget effect) on the CO2 storage. The chosen methodology is the designs of experiments. The simulations are carried out using reactive transport software. The studied carbonated reservoir is built in reference to the Dogger formation of Paris Basin (France) [Diedro (2009) These, Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines de St-Etienne]. This reservoir is composed of several minerals, some of them being disposed in spots. The results show that the impact of the draw dispersion remains lower than the impact of the variogram parameters. The effect of the size of the dolomite spots within the rock on the stored carbon dioxide is to be noticed. Larger spots of the dolomite field with low concentration lead to a greater precipitation of carbonate and reduction of porosity than little spots with higher concentrations. The interaction between the sill and the range of the variogram of the initial dolomite concentration is also important. The initial calcite concentration has a slight influence only on the average porosity in the reservoir. Except for the variations of the size of the dolomite spots within the rock, small variations on the variogram parameters of the mineralogical concentration do not involve important modification of stored carbon nor of the final porosity.";;PARIS BASIN;"Chemistry; Engineering; Geosciences";"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical; Engineering, Petroleum";"[Diedro, F.; Helbert, C.; Guy, B.] Ecole Natl Super Mines, F-42023 St Etienne 2, France; [de Fouquet, C.] Mines ParisTech, Ecole Mines Paris, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France";Diedro, F (reprint author), Ecole Natl Super Mines, 158 Cours Fauriel, F-42023 St Etienne 2, France.;France;France;FRA;0;OIL & GAS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-REVUE D IFP ENERGIES NOUVELLES;;;;;68;3;529;544;;10.2516/ogst/2012049;1294-4475;1953-8189;;1294-4475 eISSN: 1953-8189;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

Modelled climate change impacts were assessed using statistical and threshold-based analysis on managed (intensive, extensive) grasslands (permanent, sown), comparing shallow and deep soils, and for an ensemble of emission scenarios, climate models, and downscaling/initialization methods. Results show a significant drift of all sites towards more arid climates by the end of the century. Significant reductions in annual water drainage and herbage protein content are projected, together with new opportunities for annual and seasonal herbage production, in spring and winter especially. Simulated future conditions also show an increased interannual and seasonal variability of production. Contrary to expectations, current natural conditions reflecting large water availability are not expected to reduce future risks of negative climate change impacts on grassland systems. Notably, milk production from aftermath grazing of permanent grasslands established on deep soils at Mirecourt (humid site) is estimated to fall down below one-third of the current median value in four out of 30 years (similar to 13%) for 2070-2099, whereas similar shortfalls were not observed with the baseline climate. Balancing risks and opportunities, permanent extensive grasslands can be viewed as a trade-off between the continuity of grassland service provision and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.

Identifying the role and interplay of different potential stressors becomes a key question. Anadromous fishes will be exposed to both river and oceanic habitat changes. For Atlantic salmon, the river water temperature, river flow and oceanic growth conditions appear as three main stressing factors. They could act on population dynamics or as selective forces on life-history pathways. Using an individual-based demo-genetic model, we assessed the effects of these factors (1) to compare risks of extinction resulting from CC in river and ocean, and (2) to assess CC effects on life-history pathways including the evolution of underlying genetic control of phenotypic plasticity. We focused on Atlantic salmon populations from Southern Europe for a time horizon of three decades. We showed that CC in river alone should not lead to extinction of Southern European salmon populations. In contrast, the reduced oceanic growth appeared as a significant threat for population persistence. An increase in river flow amplitude increased the risk of local extinction in synergy with the oceanic effects, but river temperature rise reduced this risk. In terms of life-history modifications, the reduced oceanic growth increased the age of return of individuals through plastic and genetic responses. The river temperature rise increased the proportion of sexually mature parr, but the genetic evolution of the maturation threshold lowered the maturation rate of male parr. This was identified as a case of environmentally driven plastic response that masked an underlying evolutionary response of plasticity going in the opposite direction. We concluded that to counteract oceanic effects, river flow management represented the sole potential force to reduce the extinction probability of Atlantic salmon populations in Southern Europe, although this might not impede changes in migration life history.;"diadromous fish; ecogenetic modelling; evolutionary demography; extinction risk; life-history strategies; phenotypic plasticity; population dynamics; river flow management; Salmo salar";"LIFE-HISTORY VARIATION; ALTERNATIVE REPRODUCTIVE TACTICS; DENSITY-DEPENDENT GROWTH; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; CHINOOK SALMON; SALAR L.; WATER TEMPERATURE; GENETIC-VARIATION; REACTION NORMS; SMOLT SIZE";Environment/Ecology;"Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences";"[Piou, Cyril; Prevost, Etienne] INRA, UMR ECOBIOP 1224, F-64310 Quartier Ibarron, St Pee Sur Nive, France; [Piou, Cyril; Prevost, Etienne] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, UFR Sci & Tech Cote Basque, F-64600 Anglet, France; [Piou, Cyril] CIRAD, UPR Bioagresseurs Anal & Maitrise Risque, F-34398 Montpellier, France";Piou, C (reprint author), CIRAD BIOS, TA A106-D,Campus Int Baillarguet, F-534398 Montpellier, France.;France;France;FRA;9;GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY;;;;;19;3;711;723;;10.1111/gcb.12085;1354-1013;1365-2486;;1354-1013 eISSN: 1365-2486;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;5 - Exceptionelle

Therefore, it may become necessary to use BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) technologies to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. This technique is gaining increasing attention as it offers the dual benefit of providing low-carbon energy products and leading to negative CO2 emissions. This study evaluates the possible deployment of BECCS in the power sector using the bottom-up multiregional optimization model TIAM-FR (TIMES Integrated Assessment Model France). Under two climate scenarios, a regional analysis is conducted to discuss where the technology will be developed. The impact of the unavailability of this technology on the structure of the electricity mix and the cost of the energy system completes the analysis. In line with literature, the results suggest that BECCS technology offers an environmentally and economically viable option to achieve stringent targets. The regional analysis shows that industrialized countries will develop CCS (carbon capture and storage) mainly on biomass power plants while CCS on fossil fuel power plants will be widely deployed in China. With a specific constraint on CCS diffusion, the share of renewables and nuclear energy becomes significant to meet the climate targets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The adaptive capacity of forest tree populations is huge but not limitless. Integrating evolutionary considerations into adaptive forestry practice will enhance the capacity of managed forests to respond to climate-driven changes. Focusing on natural regeneration systems, we propose a general framework that can be used in various and complex local situations by forest managers, in combination with their own expertise, to integrate evolutionary considerations into decision making for the emergence of an evolution-oriented forestry. We develop a simple process-based analytical grid, using few processes and parameters, to analyse the impact of forestry practice on the evolution and evolvability of tree populations. We review qualitative and, whenever possible, quantitative expectations on the intensity of evolutionary drivers in forest trees. Then, we review the effects of actual and potential forestry practice on the evolutionary processes. We illustrate the complexity of interactions in two study cases: the evolutionary consequences for forest trees of biotic interactions and of highly heterogeneous environment. Evolution-oriented forestry may contribute adapting forests to climate change. It requires combining short-term and long-term objectives.

Nonetheless, the current knowledge on the biology, ecology of these species is scattered and no efficient management strategies are currently available. Based on the existing literature and field observations from the French forest health service, we firstly identified the prominent BWB species implicated in oak declines in Europe. Secondly we performed a state of the art on the biology and ecology of these species, with a particular reference to the interactions with their host trees. Finally considerations were made on how climate change could affect these interactions. Six species, namely Agrilus biguttatus, Coraebus florentinus, Coraebus undatus, Cerambyx cerdo, Platypus cylindrus and Scolytus intricatus are frequently implicated in oak declines in Europe. The interactions with their hosts regarding selection and resistance are generally poorly known. Likewise, these beetles are associated with a diverse microbial community, which composition and implication in the biology of insects and decline processes is unclear in most cases. Climate change will probably increase the frequency and distribution of oak declines in Europe. It will also likely modify the interactions between oaks and these beetles by promoting contributing factors of decline, modifying directly and indirectly host resistance, phenology and attractiveness, and beetles development, distribution and interaction with microorganisms. Evidences point out that the increase in temperature has already favored the distribution and development of C florentinus and could enhance the development of other species. Potential research prospects are proposed, aiming at acquiring missing basic knowledge and improving the currently limited management strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Geochemical modeling is an interesting tool to assess the geochemical behavior of CO2 in the saline aquifer, including its dissolution in the brine and its interactions with minerals. Two key parameters which determine the confidence one can have in the results of geochemical modeling are tested in this paper: (i) the establishment of the conceptual model, including the selection of the primary and secondary minerals expected to react; and (ii) the activity model and the associated thermodynamic databases to calculate the interaction energies within the saline solution. In this study, we performed an analysis of a large set of CO2 storage natural analogs, which makes it possible to identify the minerals that are likely to precipitate and dissolve during CO2-brine-rock interactions. Interestingly, this analysis indicates a strong dependence of Dawsonite precipitation on the initial sandstone mineralogy. Dawsonite can precipitate in lithic and feldspar rich sandstones but was not observed in quartz rich sandstones. These observations on mineral reactivity are used to establish reactivity conceptual models for three CO2 storage case-studies in saline sandstone aquifers (Ketzin, In Salah and Snohvit) and a methodology is proposed to evaluate the long-term geochemical reactivity of these saline aquifers as a result of CO2 injection. Noticeable differences are obtained between the case-studies as a function of the initial mineralogy and chemical conditions in the sandstones, which highlight that CO2 mineral trapping can take place in a given storage site but can be almost absent in other storage sites. Regarding the activity model and the database, the Pitzer interaction model is rarely used for simulating CO2 geochemical behavior in saline aquifers despite the fact that more conventionally used activity models are not valid for such salinities. A comparison between calculated mineral solubility evolution with salinity versus experimental data is performed here using both B-dot and Pitzer activity models as well as six different databases. This comparison exercise shows that chemical interactions within saline solutions can only be reproduced using the Pitzer model, even though Pitzer databases are still incomplete or are not coherent for a wide range of chemical species and temperatures. The geochemical simulations of CO2 injection in Ketzin, In Salah and Snohvit saline aquifers give divergent results using different activity models and databases. A high uncertainty on the simulation results is then linked to the database choice and this study clearly stresses the need for a Pitzer database that can be confidently used in all physical/chemical conditions found in deep sedimentary aquifers.

Kreher in 1955. A workable day is a day that provides conditions agronomically correct for work. Methods and results: A survey among grapevine growers was carried out to collect their perception of practice sensitivity to weather variability. The study provided information on working periods, techniques and machinery involved, weather constraints and thresholds generally used by the vine growers, for 21 annual cropping practices. Pesticide spraying against powdery and downy mildew appeared to be the most sensitive to weather parameters. Therefore, this practice was selected for the purpose of modelling workable days, according to decision rules based on the postulate that all weather parameters should be within the acceptable ranges. The model was run over a period of 13 years (1998-2010). Analyses of the outputs pointed out a great variability in the number of workable days from one year to another as well as in the respective proportion of unfavourable weather factors involved in the reduction of workable days. A validation based on the analysis of the actual spraying practices realized over a period of 12 years (1999-2010) showed that 32 % of the treatments were done on a day characterized as not workable by the model. The errors could be attributed to periods of holidays and risky sanitary situations when decision rules had to be bypassed. Conclusion: The model proved to represent rather well the decision rules use by vine growers to carry out their annual cropping practices in relation with the weather variability, within the area of study. The controversial role of the 'leaf wetness duration' weather parameter needs to be clarified; it may help to better parametrize the model. In order to improve its performance, the model should be coupled to a disease propagation model. Significance and impact of the study: In a climate change perspective, modelling of workable days can be run with simulated climatic data. It may prove to be useful to adapt vineyard management strategies in terms of innovative cropping practices and equipment.";"workable day; viticultural practice; weather factor; modelling; climate change";"SOIL WORKABILITY; LOIRE VALLEY; WINE; GRAPEVINE; TERROIRS";"Agricultural Sciences; Plant & Animal Science";"Food Science & Technology; Horticulture";"[Barbeau, Christine; Barbeaul, Gerard] UMT VINITERA, INRA UE1117, F-49071 Beaucouze, France; [Joannon, Alexandre] INRA SADPAYSAGE, F-35042 Rennes, France";Barbeaul, G (reprint author), UMT VINITERA, INRA UE1117, 42 rue Georges Morel, BP 60057, F-49071 Beaucouze, France.;France;France;FRA;0;JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL DES SCIENCES DE LA VIGNE ET DU VIN;;;;;48;2;141;152;;;1151-0285;;;1151-0285;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;3 - Correcte

In such a case, the transferability of calibrated parameters under non-stationary conditions needs to be addressed, especially in the context of climate change. To this end, we used the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) in the Upper Durance watershed located in the French Alps, which experienced a significant increase in temperature over the last century. The CLSM is forced by a 50-year meteorological dataset of good quality. Four parameters of the CLSM (one related to snow processes and three to soil properties) are calibrated against discharge observations with a multi-objective algorithm. First, the robustness of the CLSM parameterizations is tested by the Differential Split Sample Test (DSST). The simulations show good performances over a wide range of retrospective climatic conditions, except when the parameters are calibrated over a period with a large contribution of snowmelt to annual mean discharge. Then, the use of a climate change scenario reveals that the parameterizations of soil moisture processes in the CLSM are responsible for an increasing dispersion among simulations when facing dry and warm conditions. However, the differences between the simulated changes of river discharge remain very small. This work shows that calibration conveys some uncertainties, but they are moderate in the studied case, and pertain to the most conceptual parameterizations of this physically-based model.;"land surface model; multi-objective calibration; non-stationarity; climate change; DSST";"MULTICRITERIA METHODS; DEPLETION CURVES; SVAT MODEL; CALIBRATION; CATCHMENT; VARIABILITY; RESOLUTION; RIVER; SNOW; UNCERTAINTY";"Engineering; Environment/Ecology";Water Resources;"[Magand, C.; Ducharne, A.; Le Moine, N.; Brigode, P.] UPMC, Paris, France";Magand, C (reprint author), UPMC, Paris, France.;France;France;FRA;0;HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES;;;;;60;7-8;1408;1423;;10.1080/02626667.2014.993643;0262-6667;2150-3435;;0262-6667 eISSN: 2150-3435;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

We show, both theoretically and numerically, that when all the particles have been trapped in the wave potential, the distribution in action exhibits a very sharp peak about the smallest action. Moreover, as the wave keeps growing, the most probable action tends toward a constant, I-f, which we estimate theoretically. In particular, we show that I-f may be calculated very accurately when the particles' motion before trapping is far from adiabatic by making use of a perturbation analysis in the wave amplitude. This fills a gap regarding the computation of the action change, which, in the past, has only been addressed for slowly varying dynamics. Moreover, when the variations of the dynamics are fast enough, we show that the Fourier components of the particles' distribution function can be calculated by connecting estimates from our perturbation analysis with those obtained by assuming that all the particles have the same constant action, I = I-f. This result is used to compute theoretically the imaginary part of the electron susceptibility of an electrostatic wave in a plasma. Moreover, using our formula for the electron susceptibility, we can extend the range in is an element of(a) (the parameter that quantifies the slowness of the dynamics) for our perturbative estimate of I-f - I-0. This range can actually be pushed down to values of is an element of(a) allowing the use of neoadiabatic techniques to compute the jump in action. Hence, this paper shows that the action change due to trapping can be calculated theoretically, regardless of the rate of variation of the dynamics, by connecting perturbative results with neoadiabatic ones.;;;"Engineering; Mathematics; Physics";"Physics, Fluids & Plasmas; Physics, Mathematical";"[Benisti, Didier; Gremillet, Laurent] CEA, DAM, DIF, F-91297 Arpajon, France";Benisti, D (reprint author), CEA, DAM, DIF, F-91297 Arpajon, France.;France;France;FRA;0;PHYSICAL REVIEW E;;;;;91;4;;;042915;10.1103/PhysRevE.91.042915;1539-3755;1550-2376;;1539-3755 eISSN: 1550-2376;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente

In the Wilaya of Algiers, a risk assessment study has been undertaken by the consulting firm Egis EAU in partnership with the Algerian Ministry of Regional Development and Environment. Financed by the French Caisse des Depots, jointly supervised by the World Bank, and hosted by the Center for Mediterranean Integration, the program on cities and climate change is based on a risk methodology, which can be easily customized based on the local context. The study was based on the collection of past studies on recent disasters, aerial photographs and satellite images, digital terrain models, databases as well as Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The study area consists mostly of dense residential and industrial spaces. Overall, the study assesses the vulnerabilities of Algiers when dealing with climate change and natural disasters up to 2030, and proposes a set of recommendations to improve risk management capacities of the Wilaya of Algiers.;;;Environment/Ecology;Environmental Sciences;Ctr Mediterranean Integrat, F-13007 Marseille, France;Boughedir, S (reprint author), Ctr Mediterranean Integrat, 271 Corniche Kennedy, F-13007 Marseille, France.;France;France;FRA;1;CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY;;;;;13;;103;108;;10.1016/j.cosust.2015.03.001;1877-3435;1877-3443;;1877-3435 eISSN: 1877-3443;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;4 - Excellente
WOS:000352675600011;;Contrasting tropical estuarine ecosystem functioning and stability: A comparative study;2015;Villanueva, MC;Villanueva, Maria Ching;ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE Volume: 155 Pages: 89-103 Published: 2015;English;Article;A comparative study of the Sine-saloum (Senegal) and Gambia (The Gambia) estuaries was performed based on trophic model outputs that describe the system structure and functioning. These trophic models were constructed such as to differentiate main energetic flows in the systems and express how climate change may have impacted ecosystem resilience to change. Estuarine fish assemblages are highly resilient despite exposure to vast hydrodynamic variations and stress. Coupled with strong anthropogenic-driven stresses such as fisheries and climate change, ecosystems may undergo severe regime shifts that may weaken their resilience and stability. Taxonomically related and morphologically similar species do not necessarily play similar ecological roles in these two ecosystems. Biomass and production in the Sine-saloum are concentrated at trophic levels (TLs) 2 and 3, while for the Gambia, both are concentrated at TL3. Higher TL biomasses in Gambia compared to Sine-Saloum may be explained by the latter ecosystem being characterized by inverse hypersalinity. Higher TL. of production in Sine-Saloum is due to higher exploitations compared to Gambia where fishing activities are still less developed. High production and consumption rates of some groups in both ecosystems indicate high system productivity. Elevated productivity may be due to higher abundance of juvenile fishes in most groups that utilize the latter as refuge and/or nursery zones. Both ecosystems are phytoplankton-driven. Differences in group trophic and ecological roles are mainly due to adaptive responses of these species to seasonal and long-term climate and anthropogenic stressors. System indicators suggest different levels of ecosystem resilience and stability as a function of biodiversity. Relevance of other observations on ecosystem functioning and indicators in relation to perturbation is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

From the 1940s, new technologies, like carbon dating, ice- and sea-core drilling, and pollen analysis not only vastly expanded time horizons in geophysical and climatological research, but also pinpointed past events on a newly historical timescale. Using natural proxy indicators, these studies brought to light a series of globally disruptive events in geological time, for example, volcanic eruptions of previously unknown scale and types that had also an impact on the Earth's climate. The past became discrete. Knowing more about the past also meant knowing more about possible futures, given that some catastrophic events have occurred repeatedly or have become increasingly predictable with the help of computer modeling. This meant that scientists' claims about the future of the earth increasingly came to interfere with politics and with traditional economic planning. The paper argues that the new past has come to weigh in two ways on the present and the future. First, it dwarfed the human time scale, thus increasing the challenge of dealing with heterogeneous time scales. Second, prehistoric past events came to take on political significance. The deep past became part of political history, and thus of politics.;"Deep time; political history; history of paleoclimatology; climate change; volcanology; geoengineering";ERUPTION;"Economics & Business; Social Sciences";"History; History Of Social Sciences; Industrial Relations & Labor; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary";Strasbourg Univ, IRIST, F-67000 Strasbourg, France;Dorries, M (reprint author), Strasbourg Univ, IRIST, 7 Rue Univ, F-67000 Strasbourg, France.;France;France;FRA;1;HISTORICAL SOCIAL RESEARCH-HISTORISCHE SOZIALFORSCHUNG;;;;;40;2;22;36;;;0172-6404;;;0172-6404;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;3 - Correcte

Based on scientific publications, statistics and field observations, it reviews greenhouse gas emission levels from livestock, the ability of ruminant livestock systems to sequester carbon and the capacity of the livestock industry to meet the challenge of sustainable development and to share its benefits while minimising impacts to climate change. Special attention is paid to the situation of the 800 million livestock farmers in the world living at the extreme end of poverty. The study underlines the importance of improving livestock productivity and the interdependence of the economic, environmental and social components of sustainable development. It highlights how, in the least developed countries and most lower-middle-income countries, the pressure exerted by animal diseases hampers efforts to improve livestock productivity. Poor livestock farmers have not sufficiently benefited from development policies and need support to adopt technological advances to meet the challenges of sustainable development and poverty reduction.;"Development policy; Environment; Greenhouse gas; Livestock production; Livestock productivity; Poverty reduction; Sustainable development";"GROWTH; CATTLE; BEEF";Plant & Animal Science;Veterinary Sciences;World Org Anim Hlth, F-75017 Paris, France;Pradere, JP (reprint author), World Org Anim Hlth, 12 Rue Prony, F-75017 Paris, France.;France;France;FRA;0;REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES;;;;;33;3;765;781;;;0253-1933;;;0253-1933;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;3 - Correcte

These two mechanisms enable trees to cope with rapid climate change. We studied two European temperate tree species (sessile oak and European beech), focusing on (i) in situ variations of leaf functional traits (morphological and physiological) along two altitudinal gradients and (ii) the extent to which these variations were under environmental and/or genetic control using a common garden experiment. For all traits, altitudinal trends tended to be highly consistent between species and transects. For both species, leaf mass per area displayed a positive linear correlation with altitude, whereas leaf size was negatively correlated with altitude. We also observed a significant increase in leaf physiological performance with increasing altitude: populations at high altitudes had higher maximum rates of assimilation, stomatal conductance and leaf nitrogen content than those at low altitudes. In the common garden experiment, genetic differentiation between populations accounted for 0-28% of total phenotypic variation. However, only two traits (leaf mass per area and nitrogen content) exhibited a significant cline. The combination of in situ and common garden experiments used here made it possible to demonstrate, for both species, a weaker effect of genetic variation than of variations in natural conditions, suggesting a strong effect of the environment on leaf functional traits. Finally, we demonstrated that intrapopulation variability was systematically higher than interpopulation variability, whatever the functional trait considered, indicating a high potential capacity to adapt to climate change.;"adaptation; altitude; common garden; functional traits; genetic variation; phenotypic variations";"CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; RUBISCO ACTIVATION STATE; LEAF-NITROGEN-CONTENT; COMMON GARDEN; ECOPHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS; METROSIDEROS-POLYMORPHA; GAS-EXCHANGE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE";Plant & Animal Science;Forestry;"[Bresson, Caroline C.; Vitasse, Yann; Kremer, Antoine; Delzon, Sylvain] Univ Bordeaux, UMR BIOGECO 1202, F-33405 Talence, France; [Bresson, Caroline C.; Kremer, Antoine; Delzon, Sylvain] INRA, UMR BIOGECO 1202, F-33610 Cestas, France";Delzon, S (reprint author), Univ Bordeaux, UMR BIOGECO 1202, Bat B8,Ave Fac, F-33405 Talence, France.;France;France;FRA;30;TREE PHYSIOLOGY;;;;;31;11;1164;1174;;10.1093/treephys/tpr084;0829-318X;;;0829-318X;;non;0;;non;0;;;;;;5 - Exceptionelle
